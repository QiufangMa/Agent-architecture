--- abstract

A Network Digital Twin (NDT) provides a network emulation tool for
scenario planning, impact analysis, and change management. Integrating
a Network Digital Twin into network management together with AI, it allows the network management
activities to take user intent or service requirements as input,
automatically assess, model, and refine optimization strategies under real conditions
but in a risk-free environment. An environment that operates to meet these types of
requirements is said to have service oriented AI for Network Operations.

AI for Network Operations brings together existing technologies such
as Network Digital Twin and AI which may be seen as the use of a toolbox
of existing components enhanced with a few new elements.

This document describes an architecture and framework for service oriented AI for Network
Operations and shows how these components work together. It provides a
cookbook of existing technologies to satisfy the architecture and realize
intent based networking to meet the needs of the network service.

# Introduction

The rapid expansion of network scale and the increasing demands on these networks necessitate
making network change better adapt to ever-changing service requirements.

Since network changes are directly related to service operations, any successful change
needs to not only ensure that new services are provisioned smoothly, but also that existing
services are not affected and that no problems are introduced. Network operators or O&M personnel
are, therefore, increasingly cautious about making network changes, given that they need to review
the solution design as well as evaluate all change impacts, before making any change. Then, after
the change, they need to perform dialing tests, monitor traffic, and manually check table entries.

A Network Digital Twin (NDT) {{?I-D.irtf-nmrg-network-digital-twin-arch}} was developed to provide a
network emulation tool for scenario planning, impact analysis, and change management. Integrating
a Network Digital Twin into network management together with AI, it allows network management activities
to dynamically adapt to customer needs,
automatically assess, model, and refine optimization strategies under real conditions
but in a risk-free environment. An environment that operates to meet these types of
requirements is said to have service oriented AI for network operations.

Service oriented AI for Network Operations provide the following types of service to applications by
coordinating the components that operate and manage the network:

* Service intent and service assurance work together to ensure that the
  network change or network optimization aligns with business goals and that the services provided
  meet the agreed-upon Service Level Agreements (SLAs).

* Provide Network capacity planning and ensure that the network has sufficient capacity
  , resources, and infrastructure to meet current and future demands.

* Model the protocol operations and interactions among devices in the network and simulate specific
  networking protocols such as IS-IS, OSPF, BGP, SR to understand how they perform under
  different conditions.

* Model traffic flow across the network, including traffic generation, flow control, routing, and
  congestion control and evaluate traffic's impact on network performance.

This document describes an architecture and framework for service oriented AI for network
operations, showing how these components work together. It provides a
cookbook of existing technologies to satisfy the architecture and realize
intent based networking to meet the needs of the applications.

# Introduction of Concepts

## Generative AI and AI Agent

The integration of AI into network operations has marked a significant leap forward in
the pursuit of network automation and intelligence, while generative AI further
enhances the role of AI in network operations and management. Generative AI is a
subfield of AI that uses generative models such as LLMs to generate new and
original content such as text, images, videos, or other forms of data with the
capability to adapt and make decisions to achieve specific goals.
{{TMF-1218}} lists full-stack AI as one of key requirements of Autonomous Network capabilities,
and {{TMF-1345}} highlights the potential of generative AI in driving the evoluation
of autonomous networks. Other SDOs like ETSI (Experiential Networked Intelligence) ENI
is actively advancing the integration of AI in networks and services {{ETSI-ENI035}}.

AI agent which takes the power of generative AI a step further refers to a system
or program that uses AI to perform tasks on behalf of users.
AI Agent is an autonomous entity that can perceive the environment, make decisions,
and take actions to achieve specific goals. In the context of network operations
and management, agents are increasingly being designed to perform tasks such as
understanding user intent, generating network configurations, diagnosing and resolving network
incidents {{?I-D.ietf-nmop-network-incident-yang}}.

## Network Digital Twin

The Network Digital Twin is a digital representation that is used in the context
of network. The concept and archiecture of the Network Digital Twin are specified
in {{I-D.irtf-nmrg-network-digital-twin-arch}}. Three core functional components
which includes Data Repository component, a Service Mapping Models component,
and an NDT Management component are introduced to characterize the Network Digital
Twin and its reference architecture.

The Network Digital Twin is widely recognized to be useful as an advanced platform
for network emulation, serving as a tool for scenario planning, impact analysis,
and change management. By delivering applications requests to the Network Digital
Twin through standardized interfaces (see
{{Section 9.4 of ?I-D.irtf-nmrg-network-digital-twin-arch}}), the Network Digital
Twin exposes the various capabilities to network applications.

# Characteristics of AI for Network Operations

AIOPS was first defined by Gartner in 2016, combining "artificial intelligence"
and "IT operations" to describe the application of AI and machine learning to
enhance IT operations. However there is no unified definition for characteristic
of "AI for network operations" within the networking industry.  Referring to the
characteristics of AIOPS in IT field and the characteristics of networking itself,
this document introduces six key elements (i.e., awareness, decision, analysis, execution, intent and knowledge) to
characterize the AI for network operation and its use, as shown in {{ops-arch}}.
They together form a close-loop of network operation and management.

{: #ops-arch title="Six Key Elements to Characterize AI for network operation" artwork-align="center"}

* Intent:
: Intent is defined as a set of operational goals and outcomes defined in a declarative
  manner without specifying how to achieve or implement them in {{?RFC9315}}. The AI agent
  must accurately intepret and understand the user's high-level business or operational
  objectives, this involves translating declarative requirements into specific network
  instructions, e.g., configurations.

* Decision:
: Based on the intent and network analysis, the AI agent makes
  informed decisions. These decisions could involve dynamically adjusting network
  parameters, e.g., rerouting traffic to avoid congestion. The decision-making
  process is driven by predefined policies, real-time data analysis, and AI
  models (e.g., LLMs) that enable the AI agent to choose the best course of action
  to meet the specified intent. AI agent may also verify the correctness the decision
  by performing some network simulation or validation process.

* Analysis:
: The AI agent continuously analyzes vast amounts of network data from various
  source, including network telemetry {{?RFC9232}} and external feeds, and identify
  the gap between user intent and the existing network status. Leveraging machine
  learning and other data analytics techniques, it also identifies
  network fault, problem, incident, anomaly, and so on. Their distinction is further
  discussed in {{?I-D.ietf-nmop-terminology}}.

* Awareness:
: Awareness is achieved through real-time monitoring and data collection.
  The AI agent maintains a comprehensive visibility of the network,
  enabling it to make context-aware decisions. Network operators can also use the
  awareness understand the root cause of specific network issues and achieve closed-loop
  decision-making.

* Execution:
: Once a decision is made, the AI agent executes the necessary actions to implement
  it. This could involve, e.g., sending configuration to network devices through
  NETCONF/RESTCONF protocols. The execution is carried out in a controlled and
  precise manner to ensure that the network behaves as intended without causing
  disruptions. The AI agent also verifies that the executed actions have the
  desired effect and makes adjustments if needed.

* Knowledge:
: The AI agent relies on a knowledge base that includes network policies,
  historical data, expert experience, and best practices in product manual. The
  knowledge is used to inform its analysis, decision-making, and execution processes.
  Over time, the AI agent can expand its knowledge through machine learning,
  incorporating new data and experiences to improve its performance. For example,
  it learns which configurations are optimal for specific scenarios or how to
  respond most effectively to particular types of network incidents {{?I-D.ietf-nmop-network-incident-yang}}.
