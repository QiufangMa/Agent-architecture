# Introduction

The rapid expansion of network scale and the increasing demands on these networks necessitate
making network change better adapt to ever-changing service requirements.

Since network changes are directly related to service operations, any successful change
needs to not only ensure that new services are provisioned smoothly, but also that existing
services are not affected and that no problems are introduced. Network operators or O&M personnel
are, therefore, increasingly cautious about making network changes, given that they need to review
the solution design as well as evaluate all change impacts, before making any change. Then, after
the change, they need to perform dialing tests, monitor traffic, and manually check table entries.

A Network Digital Twin (NDT) {{?I-D.irtf-nmrg-network-digital-twin-arch}} was developed to provide a
network emulation tool for scenario planning, impact analysis, and change management. Integrating
a Network Digital Twin into network management together with AI, it allows network management activities
to dynamically adapt to customer needs, network changes, automatically assess, model, and refine optimization
strategies under real conditions but in a risk-free environment. An environment that operates to meet these
types of requirements is said to have service oriented AI for network operations.

Service oriented AI for Network Operations provide the following types of service to applications by
coordinating the components that operate and manage the network:

* Service intent and service assurance work together to ensure that the
  network change or network optimization aligns with business goals and that the services provided
  meet the agreed-upon Service Level Agreements (SLAs).

* Provide Network capacity planning and ensure that the network has sufficient capacity
  , resources, and infrastructure to meet current and future demands.

* Model the network configuration change and use a virtual topology model to test and network change
  and assess the effect of the network configuration changes on the network.

* Model the protocol operations and interactions among devices in the network and simulate specific
  networking protocols such as IS-IS, OSPF, BGP, SR to understand how they perform under
  different conditions.

* Model traffic flow across the network, including traffic generation, flow control, routing, and
  congestion control and evaluate traffic's impact on network performance.

This document describes an architecture and framework for service oriented AI for network
operations, showing how these components work together. It provides a
cookbook of existing technologies to satisfy the architecture and realize
intent based networking to meet the needs of the applications.

# Introduction of Concepts

## Generative AI and AI Agent

The integration of AI into network operations has marked a significant leap forward in
the pursuit of network automation and intelligence, while generative AI further
enhances the role of AI in network operations and management. Generative AI is a
subfield of AI that uses generative models such as LLMs to generate new and
original content such as text, images, videos, or other forms of data with the
capability to adapt and make decisions to achieve specific goals.
{{TMF-1218}} lists full-stack AI as one of key requirements of Autonomous Network capabilities,
and {{TMF-1345}} highlights the potential of generative AI in driving the evoluation
of autonomous networks. Other SDOs like ETSI (Experiential Networked Intelligence) ENI
is actively advancing the integration of AI in networks and services {{ETSI-ENI035}}.

AI agent which takes the power of generative AI a step further refers to a system
or program that uses AI to perform tasks on behalf of users.
AI Agent is an autonomous entity that can perceive the environment, make decisions,
and take actions to achieve specific goals. In the context of network operations
and management, agents are increasingly being designed to perform tasks such as
understanding user intent, generating network configurations, diagnosing and resolving network
incidents {{?I-D.ietf-nmop-network-incident-yang}}.

## Network Digital Twin

The Network Digital Twin is a digital representation that is used in the context
of network. The concept and architecture of the Network Digital Twin are specified
in {{I-D.irtf-nmrg-network-digital-twin-arch}}. Three core functional components
which includes Data Repository component, a Service Mapping Models component,
and an NDT Management component are introduced to characterize the Network Digital
Twin and its reference architecture.

The Network Digital Twin is widely recognized to be useful as an advanced platform
for network emulation, serving as a tool for scenario planning, impact analysis,
and change management. By delivering applications requests to the Network Digital
Twin through standardized interfaces (see
{{Section 9.4 of ?I-D.irtf-nmrg-network-digital-twin-arch}}), the Network Digital
Twin exposes the various capabilities to network applications.

# Characteristics of AI for Network Operations

AIOPS was first defined by Gartner in 2016, combining "artificial intelligence"
and "IT operations" to describe the application of AI and machine learning to
enhance IT operations. However there is no unified definition for characteristic
of "AI for network operations" within the networking industry.  Referring to the
characteristics of AIOPS in IT field and the characteristics of networking itself,
this document introduces six key elements (i.e., awareness, decision, analysis,
execution, intent and knowledge) to characterize the AI for network operation and
its use, as shown in {{ops-arch}}.
They together form a close-loop of network operation and management.

{: #ops-arch title="Six Key Elements to Characterize AI for network operation" artwork-align="center"}

* Intent:
: Intent is defined as a set of operational goals and outcomes defined in a declarative
  manner without specifying how to achieve or implement them in {{?RFC9315}}. The AI agent
  must accurately interpret and understand the user's high-level business or operational
  objectives, this involves translating declarative requirements into specific network
  instructions, e.g., configurations.

* Decision:
: Based on the intent and network analysis, the AI agent makes
  informed decisions. These decisions could involve dynamically adjusting network
  parameters, e.g., rerouting traffic to avoid congestion. The decision-making
  process is driven by predefined policies, real-time data analysis, and AI
  models (e.g., LLMs) that enable the AI agent to choose the best course of action
  to meet the specified intent. AI agent may also verify the correctness the decision
  by performing some network simulation or validation process.

* Analysis:
: The AI agent continuously analyzes vast amounts of network data from various
  source, including network telemetry {{?RFC9232}} and external feeds, and identify
  the gap between user intent and the existing network status. Leveraging machine
  learning and other data analytics techniques, it also identifies
  network fault, problem, incident, anomaly, and so on. Their distinction is further
  discussed in {{?I-D.ietf-nmop-terminology}}.

* Awareness:
: Awareness is achieved through real-time monitoring and data collection.
  The AI agent maintains a comprehensive visibility of the network,
  enabling it to make context-aware decisions. Network operators can also use the
  awareness understand the root cause of specific network issues and achieve closed-loop
  decision-making.

* Execution:
: Once a decision is made, the AI agent executes the necessary actions to implement
  it. This could involve, e.g., sending configuration to network devices through
  NETCONF/RESTCONF protocols. The execution is carried out in a controlled and
  precise manner to ensure that the network behaves as intended without causing
  disruptions. The AI agent also verifies that the executed actions have the
  desired effect and makes adjustments if needed.

* Knowledge:
: The AI agent relies on a knowledge base that includes network policies,
  historical data, expert experience, and best practices in product manual. The
  knowledge is used to inform its analysis, decision-making, and execution processes.
  Over time, the AI agent can expand its knowledge through machine learning,
  incorporating new data and experiences to improve its performance. For example,
  it learns which configurations are optimal for specific scenarios or how to
  respond most effectively to particular types of network incidents {{?I-D.ietf-nmop-network-incident-yang}}.

## Functional Components

### Multi-domain Orchestrator

Multi-domain orchestrator serves as the top-level coordinator and manages the interactions
across different autonomous domains. Multi-domain orchestrator may invoke Network Digital
Twin to perform functions such as analyze, diagnose, optimize, control, and emulate
as per {{?I-D.irtf-nmrg-network-digital-twin-arch}}. It also provide means to convey user
intent to each autonomous domain through a user-facing Graphical User Interface (GUI)
or machine-to-machine North Bound Interface (NBI).

### Autonomous Domain

An autonomous domain is a self-governing unit that achieves NDT and AI driven network
autonomous management.

#### Network Digital Twin

A Network Digital Twin provides an enhanced and optimized solution in the face of increasing
network and business types, scale, and complexity. It simulates the behavior, performance,
and characteristics of the actual network, which could help in validation and testing
scenarios, analyzing and predicting network behavior without affecting the real physical network.

As depicted in {{Section 7 of ?I-D.irtf-nmrg-network-digital-twin-arch}}, the core
functional components of an Network Digital Twin includes Data Repository,
Service Mapping Models, and a Network Digital Twin Management component. The
Network Digital Twin collects the real-time operational and instrumentation data
from network through the appropriate real network-facing input interfaces, and it
delivers NDT services through appropriate application-facing output interfaces, which is the interfaces
to AI Agent(s) in {{arch}}.

#### AI Agent(s)

AI Agent(s) acts as the smart brain of the Autonomous Domain, which is responsible
for conducting AI-based analysis and making decisions regarding network operations.
It leverages the inference of LLM, the simulation of Network Digital Twin, and the
contextual and domain-specific knowledge provided by Knowledge Base to accomplish
specific network operation task.

Agents could be scenario-oriented and classified according to the function they perform.
It is also possible for multiple Agents to collaborate in some scenarios.
Multi-Agents management is needed to handle the agent instance lifecycle
(e.g., deployment, update, and retirement of AI Agent), Agent registration,
Agent discovery, and so on.

#### Knowledge Base

The Knowledge Base serves as a crucial repository of information within the
architecture. It enables the injection of expert knowledge and provides the
necessary knowledge and memory that helps AI Agent(s) make more accurate and
context-aware decisions. It also helps mitigate the hallucination problems that
can arise in large-scale models, which enhances the accuracy of task execution.
Additionally, the Knowledge Base plays a key role in providing the data needed
for techniques like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which further boosts
the system's ability to generate reliable and relevant outputs.

#### Data Collection

Data Collection component is responsible for gathering data from the physical network
through various different tools and methods (e.g., IPFIX {{?RFC7011}}, YANG-push
  {{?RFC8639}},{{?RFC8641}}, BMP {{?RFC7854}}).
It collects various types of network data including configuration data, operational data,
network topology, routing data, logs, and trace on management plane, control plane, and
forwarding plane as needed. The collected data is fed into the Network Digital Twin
and AI Agent(s) to provide with up-to-date information about the current state of
the physical network.

#### Execution

Once network decisions are made and confirmed, the Execution component performs
specific actions to the physical network, e.g., modify specific configuration on network
devices through protocols like NETCONF {{?RFC6241}} and RESTCONF {{?RFC8040}}.
It is the component that makes the planned control and management changes a reality
in the real physical network.

### Physical Network

This is the actual hardware and infrastructure that makes up the network, which
includes a set of network devices and wiring.

## Architecture Requirements

There are a couple of key requirements of the architecture to integrate
Network Digital Twin with service-oriented AI which are crucial in
ensuring the proposed architecture can handle the complex and dynamic network scenarios
for network operations and management.

### Human-in-the-loop

This allows human experts to provide guidance and make critical decisions when necessary.
By involving human in the process, the architecture can leverage their insights and
experience, ensuring AI actions align with organizational goals.

Human-in-the-loop is also helpful to provide a safeguard for complex or sensitive
decisions, where human judgement is essential to avoid potential errors or ethical dilemmas.

### Interoperability via Open Standards

Standardized protocols and interfaces facilitate smooth communication and ensures
different systems and devices from various vendors can work together seamlessly.
The interfaces between AI Agent(s) and Network Digital Twin are the application-facing
interfaces as defined in {{?I-D.irtf-nmrg-network-digital-twin-arch}}.
There are some ongoing efforts that are working on the standardization of AI Agent
communication {{?I-D.rosenberg-ai-protocols}}.

### Feedback-driven Improvement

The architecture should incorporate mechanism for continuous improvement based on
feedback. This includes collecting data on AI decisions, network performance,
and user feedback to identify areas for enhancement. By analyzing the feedback,
the system can adapt and optimize its operations over time, leading to better
performance and more accurate decision-making. For example, if an AI Agent fails
to accurately identify the root cause of a network incident, the relevant records
can be submitted as negative samples to the LLM which provides inference services,
this allows the LLM to be trained on these negative samples for optimization.
Feedback-driven improvement also enables the architecture to evolve with changing
network conditions and requirements.

### Scalability and Flexibility

The architecture must be designed to scale efficiently to accommodate growing
network demands and increasing data volumes. It should also be flexible enough
to adapt to new network scenarios and operational requirements. This means that
components should be modular, allowing for easy addition or modification of
functionality without disrupting the entire system. Scalability and flexibility
ensure that the architecture remains effective and relevant in the face of evolving
network challenges.

# AI in Network Operation: A collection of Use Cases

AI Agent could help in the following phases which are usually mentioned in network management:

* Network Planning and Design: includes the understanding of user intent,
         generation of solutions, and simulation for decision-making.
* Service Deployment: includes the construction of the physical network,
         as well as intent understanding, pre-deployment simulation, automated configuration,
         post-deployment validation, and other capabilities to enhance the efficiency
         and accuracy of network configuration for service deployment.
* Network Monitoring and Troubleshooting: includes intent monitoring, issues
         identification, solution generation, evaluation and decison-making, solution
         implementation, and service validation.
* Network Change and Optimization: involves the design, evaluation, decision-making,
         implementation, and validation of network configuration changes or optimizations
         to improve network operation efficiency.

In all phases and use cases, after the Agent performs specific action, it always
continuously monitors the network by data collection. Based on the result of network
running analysis and user explicit feedback, it may adjust and optimize the
management strategy if necessary.

## Network Configuration Change

Network configuration changes are needed in scenarios such as optimizing network
or service performance, provisioning new network services, or resolving network incidents/faults.
Network configuration change leveraging AI and Network Digital Twin may experience the following typical steps:

Step 1:
:  The network operator inputs the intent of network configuration change into the
   AI Agent using natural language. The network operator may simply explain the
   objectives and requirements of the changes.

Step 2:
: AI Agent first verifies the identity of the user requesting the change and checks the user's
  permissions to make certain types of network changes against predefined rules
  or policies. It then understands and parses the initial intent of the request,
  and leverages the powerful knowledge and reasoning capabilities of LLM to generate
  initial suggestions for specific network configuration update, which may include
  multiple possible network configuration change plans if possible.

Step 3:
: AI Agent communicates with the Network Digital Twin to validate the suggested
  configuration change, including the syntax and semantics of the configuration,
  verification of effected application and resources. The network digital Twin
  may generate a report indicating the validation result, and suggested
  configuration fix when the validation fails after network simulation leveraging
  the current physical network operational state.

Step 4:
: AI Agent may generate a configuration change plan and submit to the network operator
  for approval. Based on the feedback from the operator, AI Agent then further decides
  whether to optimize the change plan or deliver the plan to the Execution component
  to conduct the physical network configuration change.

## Network Troubleshooting

AI Agent could assist in network troubleshooting in the following significant aspects:

* Fault Identification:
: AI Agent continuously monitors and aggregates data from various sources, the
  comprehensive data collection provides a holistic view of the network operational
  state. By analyzing the real-time data, AI Agent could detect network
  anomalies swiftly, which enables the prompt identification of potential issues
  before they escalate into major faults, minimizing downtime or service disruptions.

* Fault Diagnosis:
: Once a fault is identified, AI Agent delves into diagnosing the root cause, it
  may also invoke some existing operations such as "incident-diagnose" RPC defined
  in {{?I-D.ietf-nmop-network-incident-yang}}. By correlating symptoms and/or
  applying AI models trained on historical data, it can narrow down the potential
  causes and pinpoint the exact root cause, which accelerates the diagnosis process
  and reduces the time needed to address the issue.

* Fault Repair:
: After diagnosing the fault, AI Agent can generate targeted repair solutions.
  These solutions range from specific configuration adjustments to more complex
  fixes (e.g., hardware replacement). AI Agent would also communicate with
  the Network Digital Twin to simulate the proposed repair solutions and get feedback
  from the Network Digital Twin. In advanced setups, AI Agent may automatically execute
  these repairs, ensuring quick restoration of normal operations and enhancing
  the overall reliability and efficiency of network management. But it may also
  first present the fault details and repair advice to the network operator for review,
  and proceed to carry out the repair task once it is confirmed.

## Network Optimization

Network optimization is often due to the AI Agent's awareness of some potential
network faults or anomalies through continuously monitoring of network operational
state, e.g., AI models may predicts network congestion by analyzing historical
and real-time network traffic data. It may also be triggered by the network operator
actively inputting the network optimization intent.

Based on the analysis of netork data and user's intent (if any), AI Agent proposes
network optimization strategies. For instance, once the network congestion sometime
in the future is predicted, it may proactively optimize the network configuration,
or suggest scaling up to meet specific demands.

  Before the network optimization is conducted, AI Agent implements and evaluates
  the optimization solution using the Network Digital Twin. This may need repeated
  trials and validations, before the optimal strategy could be selected. AI Agent
  may also first present the suggested network optimization solution to the network
  operator for review, and apply it to the physical network after obtaining approval
  from the network operator.

# Challenges of Integrating Service-oriented AI into Network Management

## hallucination

Hallucination refers to the generation of AI responses that are incorrect, irrelevant,
or even nonsensical in relation to the input or context provided.
Although Gen-AI can produce seemingly impressive results at first glance, there's
a risk of them being completely wrong at times. These hallucinations can lead to
incorrect decisions and actions in network management. For example, if the AI
generates inaccurate network configurations or diagnoses faults incorrectly, it
may cause network disruptions or security vulnerabilities. The challenge lies
in identifying and correcting these hallucinations to ensure the reliability of
AI-driven network management actions.

## Security

Integrating AI into network management introduces new security challenges. Large
volumes of network data needs to be accessed to learn network behaviors and make
accurate decisions. Protecting sensitive network data and ensuring the integrity
of AI-generated decisions are crucial. Besides, AI systems can become targets for attacks
aimed at compromising network security. For instance, malicious actors could attempt
to manipulate AI models to make them generate harmful network configurations or
to disclose confidential network information. Additionally, the integration of AI
Agents from different vendors may create new vulnerabilities that need to be
addressed, e.g., lack of effective authentication and authorization among different Agents.
In summary, ensuring robust security measures throughout the entire AI-based network
management architecture is essential to prevent unauthorized access and maintain the
security of the network infrastructure.

## Data Quality and Consistency

The performance of AI models heavily relies on the quality and consistency of the
data they're trained on. In network management area, data sources can be diverse
and heterogeneous, leading to potential issues such as data inconsistencies,
missing, or outdated data. Poor-quality data may result in inaccurate
AI predictions and decisions. For example, if incorrect or outdated network configuration data is
provided, the model may provide incorrect repair advice when diagnosing network incidents
or faults, it may suggest checking an non-existing interface. Ensuring that data is
properly cleaned, validated, and maintained is a significant challenge in providing
reliable inputs for AI-driven network management.

## Interpretability and Explainability

AI-generated decisions can sometimes be difficult to interpret and explain,
as the AI model structure and the parameter settings make it hard to track
its internal decision-making logic. Network operators need to understand the
reasoning behind AI-driven decisions to trust and effectively
utilize them. For example, if an AI system recommends a particular configuration
change to optimize the network performance, operators may wonder why that
specific change is being suggested. The lack of interpretability can hinder
the adoption of AI in network management and make it challenging to identify
potential issues with AI-generated recommendations.
