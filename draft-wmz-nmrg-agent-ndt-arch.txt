Network Digital Twin based Architecture for AI driven Network Operations
                  draft-wmz-nmrg-agent-ndt-arch-latest

Abstract

   A Network Digital Twin (NDT) provides a network emulation tool usable
   for different purposes such as scenario planning, impact analysis,
   and change management.  Integrating a Network Digital Twin into
   network management together with AI, it allows the network management
   activities to take user intent or service requirements as input,
   automatically assess, model, and refine optimization strategies under
   realistic conditions but in a risk-free environment.  Such
   environment that operates to meet these types of requirements is said
   to have AI driven Network Operations.

   AI driven Network Operations brings together existing technologies
   such as Network Digital Twin and AI which may be seen as the use of a
   toolbox of existing components enhanced with a few new elements.

   This document describes an architecture for AI driven network
   operations and shows how these components work together.  It provides
   a cookbook of existing technologies to satisfy the architecture and
   realize intent-based networking to meet the needs of the network
   service.

1.  Introduction

   The rapid expansion of network scale and the increasing demands on
   these networks necessitate of continuous network reconfiguration to
   better adapt to ever-changing service requirements.

   Since network changes are directly related to service operations, any
   successful change needs to not only ensure that new services are
   provisioned smoothly, but also that existing services are not
   affected and that no problems are introduced with the new
   configurations.  Network operators are, therefore, increasingly
   cautious about making network changes, given that they need to review
   the solution design as well as evaluate all change impacts, before
   making any change.  Then, after the change, they need to perform
   dialling tests, monitor traffic, and manually check table entries.

   The Network Digital Twin (NDT)
   [I-D.irtf-nmrg-network-digital-twin-arch] has been proposed as a mean
   to provide a network emulation tool for scenario planning, impact
   analysis, and change management.  Integrating a Network Digital Twin
   into network management together with AI, it allows network
   management activities to dynamically adapt to customer needs, network
   changes, as well as to automatically assess, model, and refine
   optimization strategies under realistic conditions but in a risk-free
   environment.  An environment that operates to meet these types of
   requirements is said to have service-oriented AI for network
   operations.

   Service-oriented AI for network operations provide the following
   capabilities to applications by coordinating the components that
   operate and manage the network:

   *  Service intent and service assurance work together to ensure that
      the network change or network optimization aligns with business
      goals and that the services provided meet the agreed-upon Service
      Level Agreements (SLAs).

   *  Provide network capacity planning and ensure that the network has
      sufficient capacity , resources, and infrastructure to meet
      current and future demands.

   *  Provide simulation on fault scenarios, formulate recovery plans,
      and verify whether the plans are applicable and effective so that
      the service will not be affected during disaster recovery drill.

   *  Support fault and risk detection and provide network health check
      and network risk check.

   *  Model the network configuration change and use a virtual topology
      model to test network changes and assess the effect of the network
      configuration changes on the network.

   *  Model the protocol operations and interactions among devices in
      the network and simulate specific networking protocols such as IS-
      IS, OSPF, BGP, SR, etc to understand how they perform under
      different conditions.

   *  Model traffic flow across the network, including traffic
      generation, flow control, routing, and congestion control and
      evaluate traffic's impact on network performance.

   *  Support generation of rectification solutions for potential
      network risks and provide verification on the repair solution in
      seconds, including loop, address conflict, and security policy
      conflict.

   This document describes an architecture for service-oriented AI for
   network operations, showing how these components work together.  It
   provides a cookbook of existing technologies to satisfy the
   architecture and realize intent-based networking to meet the needs of
   applications.

   *  Network Digital Twin (NDT)

   *  Artificial Intelligence (AI)

   The following acronyms are used throughout this document:

   Besides, this document defines the following terminology:

   Network AI Agent:  AI Agent is an autonomous system or entity with
      awareness of its environment, capable of conducting analysis,
      making decisions, and executing actions with specific intent based
      on its knowledge representation to achieve a set of service goals
      [TMF-1251D].

3.  Introduction of Concepts

3.1.  Generative AI and AI Agent

   The integration of AI into network operations has marked a
   significant leap forward in the pursuit of network automation and
   intelligence, while generative AI further enhances the role of AI
   driven network operations and management.  Generative AI is a
   subfield of AI that uses generative models such as Large Language
   Models (LLMs) to generate new and original content such as text,
   images, videos, or other forms of data with the capability to adapt
   and make decisions to achieve specific goals.

   An AI agent refers to a system or program that Large Language Models
   (LLM)s to interact with humans (or other AI Agents) for purposes of
   performing tasks [I-D.rosenberg-ai-protocols].  In the context of
   network operations and management, Network AI agents are increasingly
   being designed to interact with physical world and act upon it based
   on tools [Google-Agents-Whitepaper] and perform network management
   tasks such as understanding user intent, generating network
   configurations, diagnosing and resolving network incidents
   [I-D.ietf-nmop-network-incident-yang].  Meanwhile, other SDOs also
   try to define terms related to Network AI agent in the context of
   network operations and management, e.g., TM Forum defines Autonomous
   Agent in [TMF-1251D] as one of AN (Autonomous Network) Terminologies.

3.2.  Network Digital Twin

   The Network Digital Twin is a digital representation that is used in
   the context of network.  The concept and architecture of the Network
   Digital Twin are specified in
   [I-D.irtf-nmrg-network-digital-twin-arch].  Three core functional
   components which includes Data Repository component, a Service
   Mapping Models component, and an NDT Management component are
   introduced to characterize the Network Digital Twin and its reference
   architecture.

   The Network Digital Twin is widely recognized to be useful as an
   advanced platform for network emulation, serving as a tool for
   scenario planning, impact analysis, and change management.  By
   delivering applications requests to the Network Digital Twin through
   standardized interfaces (see Section 9.4 of
   [I-D.irtf-nmrg-network-digital-twin-arch]), the Network Digital Twin
   exposes the various capabilities to network applications.

4.  Characteristics of AI driven Network Operations

   AIOPS was first defined by Gartner in 2016, combining "artificial
   intelligence" and "IT operations" to describe the application of AI
   and machine learning to enhance IT operations.  However there is no
   unified definition for characteristic of "AI driven network
   operations" within the networking industry.  Referring to the
   characteristics of AIOPS in IT field and the characteristics of
   networking itself, this document introduces six key elements (i.e.,
   awareness, decision, analysis, execution, intent and knowledge) to
   characterize the AI driven network operation and its use, as shown in
   Figure 1.  They together form a close-loop of network operation and
   management.

        Figure 1: Six Key Elements to Characterize AI driven network
                                 operation

   *  Intent:  Intent is defined as a set of operational goals and
         outcomes defined in a declarative manner without specifying how
         to achieve or implement them in [RFC9315].  The Network AI
         Agent must accurately interpret and understand the user's high-
         level business or operational objectives, this involves
         translating declarative requirements into specific network
         instructions, e.g., configurations.

   *  Knowledge:  The Network AI agent relies on a knowledge base that
         includes network policies, historical data, expert experience,
         extra-system experience (updates to LLMs/their implied
         ‘knowledge bases’) and Manually or semi-manually entered
         knowledge,e.g.,new equipment spec sheets,best practices in
         product manual.  The knowledge is used to inform its analysis,
         decision-making, and execution processes.  Over time, the
         Network AI agent can expand its knowledge through machine
         learning, incorporating new data and experiences to improve its
         performance.  For example, it learns which configurations are
         optimal for specific scenarios or how to respond most
         effectively to particular types of network incidents
         [I-D.ietf-nmop-network-incident-yang].

   *  Analysis:  The Network AI agent continuously analyzes vast amounts
         of network data from various sources, including network
         telemetry [RFC9232] and external feeds, and identify the gap
         between user intent and the existing network status.  By
         integrating Network digital twin
         [I-D.irtf-nmrg-network-digital-twin-arch] with Network AI agent
         and leveraging machine learning and other data analytics
         techniques, it also identifies network fault, problem,
         incident, anomaly and perform data driven intelligent analysis
         such as service impact analysis, and so on.  Their distinction
         is further discussed in [I-D.ietf-nmop-terminology].

   *  Decision:  Based on the intent and network analysis, AI makes
         informed decisions.  By integrating network digital twin
         [I-D.irtf-nmrg-network-digital-twin-arch] and AI, the
         intelligence decisions making can be realized.  These decisions
         could involve dynamically adjusting network parameters, e.g.,
         rerouting traffic to avoid congestion.  The decision-making
         process is driven by predefined policies, real-time data
         analysis, and AI models (e.g., LLMs) that enable the Network AI
         agent to choose the best course of action to meet the specified
         intent.  Network AI agent may also verify the correctness of
         the decision outcome by performing some network simulation or
         validation process.

   *  Awareness:  Awareness is achieved through real-time monitoring and
         data collection.  The Network AI agent maintains a
         comprehensive visibility of the network, enabling it to make
         context-aware decisions.  Network operators can also use the
         awareness understand the exact cause of specific network issues
         and achieve closed-loop decision-making.

   *  Execution:  Once a decision is made, the Network AI agent executes
         the necessary actions to implement it.  This could involve,
         e.g., sending configuration to network controllers or network
         devices through NETCONF/RESTCONF protocols.  The execution is
         carried out in a controlled and precise manner to ensure that
         the network behaves as intended without causing disruptions.
         The Network AI agent also verifies that the executed actions
         have the desired effect and makes the proper adjustments if
         needed.

5.2.  Functional Components

5.2.1.  Application

   One of example application is multi-domain orchestrator.  Multi-
   domain orchestrator serves as the top-level coordinator and manages
   the interactions across different autonomous domains.  Multi-domain
   orchestrator may invoke Network Digital Twin to perform functions
   such as analyze, diagnose, optimize, control, and emulate as per
   [I-D.irtf-nmrg-network-digital-twin-arch].  It also provide means to
   convey user intent to each autonomous domain through a user-facing
   Graphical User Interface (GUI) or machine-to-machine North Bound
   Interface (NBI).

5.2.2.  Autonomous Domain

   An autonomous domain is a self-governing unit that achieves NDT and
   AI driven network autonomous management.

5.2.2.1.  Network Digital Twin

   A Network Digital Twin provides an enhanced and optimized solution in
   the face of increasing network and business types, scale, and
   complexity.  It simulates the behavior, performance, and
   characteristics of the actual network, which could help in validation
   and testing scenarios, analyzing and predicting network behavior
   without affecting the real physical network.

   As described in Section 7 of
   [I-D.irtf-nmrg-network-digital-twin-arch], the core functional
   components of an Network Digital Twin includes Data Repository,
   Service Mapping Models, and a Network Digital Twin Management
   component.  The Network Digital Twin collects the real-time
   operational and instrumentation data from network through the
   appropriate real network-facing input interfaces, and it delivers NDT
   services through appropriate application-facing output interfaces,
   which is the interfaces to Network AI Agent(s) in Figure 2.

5.2.2.2.  Network AI Agent(s)

   Network AI Agent(s) act(s) as the smart brain of the Autonomous
   Domain, which is responsible for conducting AI-based analysis and
   making decisions regarding network operations and adapting to new
   circumstances through access to evolving knowledge and reasoning,
   planning.  It leverages the inference of LLM, the simulation of
   Network Digital Twin, and the contextual and domain-specific
   knowledge provided by Knowledge Base to accomplish specific network
   operation task.

   Agents could be scenario-oriented and classified according to the
   function they perform.  It is also possible for multiple Agents to
   collaborate in some scenarios.  Multi-Agents management is needed to
   handle the agent instance lifecycle (e.g., deployment, update, and
   retirement of Network AI Agent), Agent registration, Agent discovery,
   and so on.  Some ongoing efforts (MCP [MCP], A2A [A2A]) in the
   industry may help with multi-agents coordination.

5.2.2.3.  Knowledge Base

   The Knowledge Base serves as a crucial repository of information
   within the architecture.  It enables the injection of expert
   knowledge and and chain of thoughts, provides the necessary knowledge
   and memory that helps AI Agent(s) make more accurate and practive
   context-aware decisions.  It also helps mitigate the hallucination
   problems that can arise in large-scale models, which enhances the
   accuracy of task execution.  Additionally, the Knowledge Base plays a
   key role in providing the data needed for techniques like Retrieval-
   Augmented Generation (RAG), which further boosts the system's ability
   to generate reliable and relevant outputs.

   In case of coupling MCP with the nework management system, the new
   knowledge also can be used to support modification of the currently
   operating automation Closed Loop, such as: - Choice of tools (data,
   analytics, algorithms/decision processes, closed loops) -
   Orchestration of tools

5.2.2.4.  Data Collection

   Data Collection component is responsible for gathering data from the
   physical network through various different tools and methods (e.g.,
   IPFIX [RFC7011], YANG-push [RFC8639],[RFC8641], BMP [RFC7854]).  It
   collects various types of network data including configuration data,
   operational data, network topology, routing data, logs, and trace on
   management plane, control plane, and forwarding plane as needed.  The
   collected data is fed into the Network Digital Twin and Network AI
   Agent(s) to provide with up-to-date information about the current
   state of the physical network.

5.2.2.5.  Execution

   Once network decisions are made and confirmed, the Execution
   component performs specific actions to the physical network, e.g.,
   modify specific configuration on network controllers or network
   devices through protocols like NETCONF [RFC6241] and RESTCONF
   [RFC8040].  It is the component that makes the planned control and
   management changes a reality in the real physical network.

5.2.3.  Physical Network

   This is the actual hardware and infrastructure that makes up the
   network, which includes a set of network devices and wiring.  In a
   physical network, Network Elements (NEs) with Lightweight AI
   [I-D.irtf-nmrg-ai-challenges] may also achieve some local close loop
   without relying on external AI or human intervention.  It is also
   possible for the Leightweight AI to coordinate with AI Agent(s) to
   enhance the automation and efficiency of network operations.  The
   Network Leightweight AI models could be trained, validated, deployed,
   and executed on Network Elements, and further refined (e.g., model
   re-training) through monitoring and continuous optimization based on
   feedback from LLM.

5.3.  Architecture Requirements

   There are a couple of key requirements of the architecture to
   integrate Network Digital Twin with service-oriented AI which are
   crucial in ensuring the proposed architecture can handle the complex
   and dynamic network scenarios for network operations and management.

5.3.1.  Human-in-the-loop

   This allows human experts to provide guidance and make critical
   decisions when necessary.  By involving human in the process, the
   architecture can leverage their insights and experience, ensuring AI
   actions align with organizational goals.

   Human-in-the-loop is also helpful to provide a safeguard for complex
   or sensitive decisions, where human judgement is essential to avoid
   potential errors or ethical dilemmas.

5.3.2.  Interoperability via Open Standards

   Standardized protocols and interfaces facilitate smooth communication
   and ensures different systems and devices from various vendors can
   work together seamlessly.  The interfaces between Network AI Agent(s)
   and Network Digital Twin are the application-facing interfaces as
   defined in [I-D.irtf-nmrg-network-digital-twin-arch].  There are some
   ongoing efforts that are working on the standardization of Network AI
   Agent communication [I-D.rosenberg-ai-protocols].

5.3.3.  Feedback-driven Improvement

   The architecture should incorporate mechanism for continuous
   improvement based on feedback.  This includes collecting data on AI
   decisions, network performance, and user feedback to identify areas
   for enhancement.  By analyzing the feedback, the system can adapt and
   optimize its operations over time, leading to better performance and
   more accurate decision-making.  For example, if a Network AI Agent
   fails to accurately identify the exact cause of a network incident,
   the relevant records can be submitted as negative samples to the LLM
   which provides inference services, this allows the LLM to be trained
   on these negative samples for optimization.  Feedback-driven
   improvement also enables the architecture to evolve with changing
   network conditions and requirements.

5.3.4.  Scalability and Flexibility

   The architecture must be designed to scale efficiently to accommodate
   growing network demands and increasing data volumes.  It should also
   be flexible enough to adapt to new network scenarios and operational
   requirements.  This means that components should be modular, allowing
   for easy addition or modification of functionality without disrupting
   the entire system.  Scalability and flexibility ensure that the
   architecture remains effective and relevant in the face of evolving
   network challenges.

5.4.  Collaboration between small AI model and large AI model

   The architecture must be designed to support collaboration between
   small AI model and large AI model.

   In the past, we only support AI and machine learning technologies at
   the network level, e.g., we can use collected various different
   network data to provide network analysis and generate network
   insight.

   With more intelligence introduced into the network element, more GPU/
   NPU resource can be allocated for AI inference, this make
   collaboration between large AI model And small AI model become
   possible.

   Large AI models can provide basic logical reasoning and generalized
   analytical decision-making capabilities While specialized small AI
   models can provide efficient problem-solving capabilities in
   specialized areas.  The synergy between the two allows the AI agent
   to combine both multitasking generalization capabilities and domain
   expertise, thus minimizing the reliance on human intervention in the
   network management process.

   On one hand, we can use accumulated field engineering expertise to
   train large AI model into one foundation model for fault management
   AI agent, On the other hand, we can deploy small AI model, leverage
   hardware resource or chipset resource in the intelligent network
   element to collect more fine granularity data or provide local
   processing for Collected data and summary report generation, Trend
   prediction, etc.  With collaboration between large AI model and small
   AI model, we can allow Network AI Agent within the Network controller
   interact with network element and has more quick response to network
   change.

6.  AI Driven Network Operation: A collection of Use Cases

   Network AI Agent could help in the following phases which are usually
   mentioned in network management:

   *  Network Planning and Design: includes the understanding of user
      intent, generation of solutions, and simulation for decision-
      making.

   *  Service Deployment: includes the construction of the physical
      network, as well as intent understanding, pre-deployment
      simulation, automated configuration, post-deployment validation,
      and other capabilities to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of
      network configuration for service deployment.

   *  Network Monitoring and Troubleshooting: includes intent
      monitoring, issues identification, solution generation, evaluation
      and decision-making, solution implementation, and service
      validation.

   *  Network Change and Optimization: involves the design, evaluation,
      decision-making, implementation, and validation of network
      configuration changes or optimizations to improve network
      operation efficiency.

   In all phases and use cases, after the Agent performs specific
   action, it always continuously monitors the network by data
   collection.  Based on the result of network running analysis and user
   explicit feedback, it may adjust and optimize the management strategy
   if necessary.

6.1.  Network Configuration Change

   Network configuration changes are needed in scenarios such as
   optimizing network or service performance, provisioning new network
   services, or resolving network incidents/faults.  Network
   configuration change leveraging AI and Network Digital Twin may
   experience the following typical steps:

   Step 1:  The network operator inputs the intent of network
      configuration change into the Network AI Agent using natural
      language.  The network operator may simply explain the objectives
      and requirements of the changes.

   Step 2:  Network AI Agent first verifies the identity of the user
      requesting the change and checks the user's permissions to make
      certain types of network changes against predefined rules or
      policies.  It then understands and parses the initial intent of
      the request, and leverages the powerful knowledge and reasoning
      capabilities of LLM to generate initial suggestions for specific
      network configuration update, which may include multiple possible
      network configuration change plans if possible.

   Step 3:  Network AI Agent communicates with the Network Digital Twin
      to validate the suggested configuration change, including the
      syntax and semantics of the configuration, verification of
      effected application and resources.  The network digital Twin may
      generate a report indicating the validation result, and suggested
      configuration fix when the validation fails after network
      simulation leveraging the current physical network operational
      state.

   Step 4:  Network AI Agent may generate a configuration change plan
      and submit to the network operator for approval.  Based on the
      feedback from the operator, Network AI Agent then further decides
      whether to optimize the change plan or deliver the plan to the
      Execution component to conduct the physical network configuration
      change.

6.2.  Network Troubleshooting

   Network AI Agent could assist in network troubleshooting in the
   following significant aspects:

   *  Fault Identification:  Network AI Agent continuously monitors and
         aggregates data from various sources, the comprehensive data
         collection provides a holistic view of the network operational
         state.  By analyzing the real-time data, Network AI Agent could
         detect network anomalies swiftly, which enables the prompt
         identification of potential issues before they escalate into
         major faults, minimizing downtime or service disruptions.  In
         some cases, the Leightweight AI located in the Network Element
         may handle some simple fault identification tasks (e.g.,
         optical module fault automatic identification) to enhance the
         awareness, while the Network AI Agent and LLM could leverage
         their powerful processing capabilities to analyze the time-
         domain data collected from the optical module.

   *  Fault Diagnosis:  Once a fault is identified, Network AI Agent
         delves into diagnosing the exact cause, it may also invoke some
         existing operations such as "incident-diagnose" RPC defined in
         [I-D.ietf-nmop-network-incident-yang].  By correlating symptoms
         and/or applying AI models trained on historical data, it can
         narrow down the potential causes and pinpoint the exact cause,
         which accelerates the diagnosis process and reduces the time
         needed to address the issue.

   *  Fault Repair:  After diagnosing the fault, Network AI Agent can
         generate targeted repair solutions.  These solutions range from
         specific configuration adjustments to more complex fixes (e.g.,
         hardware replacement).  Network AI Agent would also communicate
         with the Network Digital Twin to simulate the proposed repair
         solutions and get feedback from the Network Digital Twin.  In
         advanced setups, Network AI Agent may automatically execute
         these repairs, ensuring quick restoration of normal operations
         and enhancing the overall reliability and efficiency of network
         management.  But it may also first present the fault details
         and repair advice to the network operator for review, and
         proceed to carry out the repair task once it is confirmed.

   *  Fault Prediction  As an advanced enhancement of fault management
         capabilities, fault prediction aims to reduce network risks
         through proactive management that prevents problems before they
         occur.  Before a fault actually occurs, the NDT constructs a
         dynamic simulation model by collecting real-time multi-
         dimensional operational state data, including network topology,
         traffic load, and device performance indicators.  Based on the
         network data, AI Agent uses large models and machine learning
         algorithms (such as time-series prediction models and anomaly
         detection models) to reason and analyze potential faults—for
         example, predicting the risk of physical link interruption
         based on optical cable signal attenuation data.  Furthermore,
         the AI Agent generates recommended operations to avoid faults
         and validates them through simulation in the NDT, thereby
         achieving predictive maintenance of the network.

6.3.  Network Optimization

   Network optimization is often introduced due to the Network AI
   Agent's awareness of some potential network faults or anomalies
   through continuously monitoring of network operational state, e.g.,
   AI models may predicts network congestion by analyzing historical and
   real-time network traffic data.  It may also be triggered by the
   network operator actively inputting the network optimization intent.

   Based on the analysis of network data and user's intent (if any), AI
   Agent proposes network optimization strategies.  For instance, once
   the network congestion sometime in the future is predicted, it may
   proactively optimize the network configuration, or suggest scaling up
   to meet specific demands.

   Before the network optimization is conducted, Network AI Agent
   implements and evaluates the optimization solution using the Network
   Digital Twin.  This may need repeated trials and validations based on
   specific evaluation criteria, before the optimal strategy could be
   selected.  Network AI Agent may also first present the suggested
   network optimization solution to the network operator for review, and
   apply it to the physical network after obtaining approval from the
   network operator.

6.4.  Network level Energy Efficiency Management

   Network level Energy Efficiency refer to a set of processes used to
   discover a inventory of capabilities, use specific metrics to monitor
   and assess energy consumption of the network , operate, and control
   the use of available energy in an optimized manner while achieving
   the network’s functional and performance requirements by improving
   overall network utilization.

   Network level Energy Efficiency allows network operators not only see
   real time energy consumption in the network devices of large scale
   network through interaction with the GREEN Network AI Agent, but also
   allow them see

   o which network devices enable energy saving, which devices not,which
   are legacy ones,

   o The total energy consumption changing trend over the time of the
   day, for all network devices,

   o Energy efficiency changing trend over the time of the day for the
   whole network.

   On the other hand, With the better observability to energy
   consumption statistics data and energy efficiency statistics data,
   the Network AI Agent can know which part of the network need to be
   adjusted or optimized based on network status change.

6.5.  Network Security Drills

   The AI Agent can help construct a dynamic attack-defense verification
   system in network security drills through NDT and AI reasoning
   capabilities.  It uses generative AI to automatically generate
   diversified attack paths, models network topologies with graph neural
   networks, covers attack stages such as reconnaissance and
   penetration, and dynamically adjusts strategies via reinforcement
   learning to simulate the adaptive characteristics of network attacks.
   The virtual range built based on the NDT can 1:1 map the production
   environment, supporting simulations of composite scenarios like
   ransomware chain attacks and supply chain attacks—such as simulating
   the entire process of Conti virus laterally penetrating to domain
   controllers through weak passwords.

   During drills, the AI Agent automatically deploys virtual
   environments with vulnerabilities, collects defense response data in
   real time through NDT, and generates attack path heatmaps and repair
   suggestions.  This capability can further verify emergency response
   processes, inject real-time threat intelligence to dynamically update
   drill scenarios, and simulate end-to-end automated deployment,
   vulnerability injection, and real-time analysis of security drills,
   enhancing the proactive verification ability of defense systems
   against real-world threats.

7.  Challenges of Integrating Service-oriented AI into Network
    Management

   In addition to the research challenges in coupling AI and network
   management specified in [I-D.irtf-nmrg-ai-challenges], this document
   also identifies some challenges that need to be considered when
   integrating service-oriented AI into network management.

7.1.  Hallucination

   Hallucination refers to the generation of AI responses that are
   incorrect, irrelevant, or even nonsensical in relation to the input
   or context provided.  Although Gen-AI can produce seemingly
   impressive results at first glance, there's a risk of them being
   completely wrong at times.  These hallucinations can lead to
   incorrect decisions and actions in network management.  For example,
   if the AI generates inaccurate network configurations or diagnoses
   faults incorrectly, it may cause network disruptions or security
   vulnerabilities.  The challenge lies in identifying and correcting
   these hallucinations to ensure the reliability of AI-driven network
   management actions.

7.2.  Security

   Integrating AI into network management introduces new security
   challenges.  Large volumes of network data needs to be accessed to
   learn network behaviors and make accurate decisions.  Protecting
   sensitive network data and ensuring the integrity of AI-generated
   decisions are crucial.  Besides, AI systems can become targets for
   attacks aimed at compromising network security.  For instance,
   malicious actors could attempt to manipulate AI models to make them
   generate harmful network configurations or to disclose confidential
   network information.  Additionally, the integration of AI Agents from
   different vendors may create new vulnerabilities that need to be
   addressed, e.g., lack of effective authentication and authorization
   among different Agents.  In summary, ensuring robust security
   measures throughout the entire AI-based network management
   architecture is essential to prevent unauthorized access and maintain
   the security of the network infrastructure.

7.3.  Data Quality and Consistency

   The performance of AI models heavily relies on the quality and
   consistency of the data they're trained on.  In network management
   area, data sources can be diverse and heterogeneous, leading to
   potential issues such as data inconsistencies, missing, or outdated
   data.  Poor-quality data may result in inaccurate AI predictions and
   decisions.  For example, if incorrect or outdated network
   configuration data is provided, the model may provide incorrect
   repair advice when diagnosing network incidents or faults, it may
   suggest checking an non-existing interface.  Ensuring that data is
   properly cleaned, validated, and maintained is a significant
   challenge in providing reliable inputs for AI-driven network
   management.

7.4.  Interpretability and Explainability

   AI-generated decisions can sometimes be difficult to interpret and
   explain, as the AI model structure and the parameter settings make it
   hard to track its internal decision-making logic.  Network operators
   need to understand the reasoning behind AI-driven decisions to trust
   and effectively utilize them.  For example, if an AI system
   recommends a particular configuration change to optimize the network
   performance, operators may wonder why that specific change is being
   suggested.  The lack of interpretability can hinder the adoption of
   AI Driven Network Management and make it challenging to identify
   potential issues with AI-generated recommendations.

7.5.  Fast Decision-making

   In network operation and maintenance scenarios with high real-time
   requirements, such as scheduling strategy optimization and critical
   fault repair, the rapid generation of network optimization decisions
   is crucial.  However, AI Agents based on large models adopt a "Token-
   based" generation and reasoning approach, which is limited by
   computing power and algorithms, resulting in generally slow reasoning
   speeds.  In addition, the simulation and verification process of
   Network Digital Twin (NDT) further increases decision latency, which
   leads to long end-to-end decision-making time in complex scenarios
   and is difficult to meet the real-time requirements of services.  To
   improve decision efficiency, continuous efforts are needed in
   lightweight NDT modeling algorithms, optimizing large model reasoning
   frameworks (such as quantization technology and parallel computing),
   and deploying high-performance AI acceleration hardware.

8.  Security Considerations

   The security consideration from
   [I-D.irtf-nmrg-network-digital-twin-arch] apply here.  In addition,
   the following architectural risks need to be considered:

   *  Single point of failure: While the architecture provides
      resiliency through its recovery capabilities, the network digital
      twin or Network AI Agent could become a single point of failure if
      not implemented with sufficientcredundancy and fault tolerance.

   *  AI/ML model integrity: If the AI/ML models used by the digital
      twin are compromised or poisoned with bad data, they could begin
      making incorrect or malicious decisions.  Robust checks and
      validation are necessary to ensure the integrity of these models.

   *  Lifecycle security: The entire lifecycle of the network AI agents
      and the network digital twin—from initial deployment and
      configuration to updates and decommissioning—must be secured
      against unauthorized access and manipulation.

9.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no requests to IANA.
