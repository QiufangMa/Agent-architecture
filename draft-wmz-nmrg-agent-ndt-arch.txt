                  draft-wmz-nmrg-agent-ndt-arch-latest

Abstract

   A Network Digital Twin (NDT) provides a network emulation tool usable
   for different purposes such as scenario planning, impact analysis,
   and change management.  Integrating a Network Digital Twin into
   network management together with Agentic AI, it allows the network
   management activities to take user intent or service requirements as
   input, automatically assess, model, and refine optimization
   strategies under realistic conditions but in a risk-free environment.
   Such environment that operates to meet these types of requirements is
   said to have AI driven Network Operations.

   AI driven Network Operations brings together existing technologies
   such as Agentic AI and Network Digital Twin which may be seen as the
   use of a toolbox of existing components enhanced with a few new
   elements.

   This document describes an architecture for AI driven network
   operations and shows how these components work together with network
   digital twin and Agentic AI capabilities.  It provides a cookbook of
   existing technologies to satisfy the architecture and realize intent-
   based network management to meet the needs of the network service.

1.  Introduction

   The rapid expansion of network scale and the increasing demands on
   these networks necessitate of continuous network reconfiguration to
   better adapt to ever-changing service requirements.

   Since network changes are directly related to service operations, any
   successful change needs to not only ensure that new services are
   provisioned smoothly, but also that existing services are not
   affected and that no problems are introduced with the new
   configurations.  Network operators are, therefore, increasingly
   cautious about making network changes, given that they need to review
   the solution design as well as evaluate all change impacts, before
   making any change.  Then, after the change, they need to perform
   dialling tests, monitor traffic, and manually check table entries.

   The Network Digital Twin (NDT)
   [I-D.irtf-nmrg-network-digital-twin-arch] has been proposed as a mean
   to provide a network emulation tool for scenario planning, impact
   analysis, and change management.  Agentic AI introduces disruptive
   paradim to the network management and allow delcarative intent
   interpretation, multi-step action, multi-agent coordination.
   Integrating a Network Digital Twin into network management together
   with Agentic AI, it allows network management activities to
   dynamically adapt to customer needs, network changes, as well as to
   automatically assess, model, and refine optimization strategies under
   realistic conditions but in a risk-free environment.  An environment
   that operates to meet these types of requirements is said to have AI
   driven network operations.

   AI Driven network operations provide the following capabilities to
   applications by coordinating the components that operate and manage
   the network:

   *  Service intent and service assurance work together to ensure that
      the network change or network optimization aligns with business
      goals and that the services provided meet the agreed-upon Service
      Level Agreements (SLAs).

   *  Provide network capacity planning and ensure that the network has
      sufficient capacity , resources, and infrastructure to meet
      current and future demands.

   *  Provide simulation on fault scenarios, formulate recovery plans,
      and verify whether the plans are applicable and effective so that
      the service will not be affected during disaster recovery drill.

   *  Support fault and risk detection and provide network health check
      and network risk check.

   *  Model the network configuration change and use a virtual topology
      model to test network changes and assess the effect of the network
      configuration changes on the network.

   *  Model the protocol operations and interactions among devices in
      the network and simulate specific networking protocols such as IS-
      IS, OSPF, BGP, SR, etc to understand how they perform under
      different conditions.

   *  Model traffic flow across the network, including traffic
      generation, flow control, routing, and congestion control and
      evaluate traffic's impact on network performance.

   *  Support generation of rectification solutions for potential
      network risks and provide verification on the repair solution in
      seconds, including loop, address conflict, and security policy
      conflict.

   This document describes an architecture for AI Driven network
   operations, showing how these components work together with network
   digital and AI capabilities.  It provides a cookbook of existing
   technologies to satisfy the architecture and realize intent-based
   networking to meet the needs of applications.

      Task agent for these sub-tasks.

   Task AI Agent:  Task AI Agent is responsible for coordinating with
      Network AI Agent in the multi-Agent System and executing specific
      task assigned by Network AI Agent.

3.  Introduction of Concepts

3.1.  Generative AI and Agentic AI

   The integration of AI into network operations has marked a
   significant leap forward in the pursuit of network automation and
   intelligence, while generative AI further enhances the role of AI
   driven network operations and management.  Generative AI is a
   subfield of AI that uses generative models such as Large Language
   Models (LLMs) to generate new and original content such as text,
   images, videos, or other forms of data with the capability to adapt
   and make decisions to achieve specific goals.

   Agentic AI refers to the broader category of AI systems that exhibit
   "agency"—the ability to act independently and iteratively to perform
   tasks without constant human prompting [I-D.hong-nmrg-agenticai-ps].
   In the context of network operations and management, Network AI
   agents are increasingly being designed to interact with physical
   world and act upon it based on tools [Google-Agents-Whitepaper] and
   perform network management tasks such as understanding user intent,
   generating network configurations, diagnosing and resolving network
   incidents [I-D.ietf-nmop-network-incident-yang].  Meanwhile, other
   SDOs also try to define terms related to Network AI agent in the
   context of network operations and management, e.g., TM Forum defines
   Autonomous Agent in [TMF-1251D] as one of AN (Autonomous Network)
   Terminologies.

3.2.  Network Digital Twin

   The Network Digital Twin is a digital representation that is used in
   the context of network.  The concept and architecture of the Network
   Digital Twin are specified in
   [I-D.irtf-nmrg-network-digital-twin-arch].  Three core functional
   components which includes Data Repository component, a Service
   Mapping Models component, and an NDT Management component are
   introduced to characterize the Network Digital Twin and its reference
   architecture.

   The Network Digital Twin is widely recognized to be useful as an
   advanced platform for network emulation, serving as a tool for
   scenario planning, impact analysis, and change management.  By
   delivering applications requests to the Network Digital Twin through
   standardized interfaces (see Section 9.4 of
   [I-D.irtf-nmrg-network-digital-twin-arch]), the Network Digital Twin
   exposes the various capabilities to network applications.

4.  Characteristics of AI driven Network Operations

   AIOPS was first defined by Gartner in 2016, combining "artificial
   intelligence" and "IT operations" to describe the application of AI
   and machine learning to enhance IT operations.  However there is no
   unified definition for characteristic of "AI driven network
   operations" within the networking industry.  Referring to the
   characteristics of AIOPS in IT field and the characteristics of
   networking itself, this document introduces six key elements (i.e.,
   awareness, decision, analysis, execution, intent and knowledge) to
   characterize the AI driven network operation and its use, as shown in
   Figure 1.  They together form a close-loop of network operation and
   management.

        Figure 1: Six Key Elements to Characterize AI driven network
                                 operation

   *  Intent:  Intent is defined as a set of operational goals and
         outcomes defined in a declarative manner without specifying how
         to achieve or implement them in [RFC9315].  The Network AI
         Agent must accurately interpret and understand the user's high-
         level business or operational objectives, this involves
         translating declarative requirements into specific network
         instructions, e.g., configurations.

   *  Knowledge:  The Network AI agent relies on a knowledge base that
         includes network policies, historical data, expert experience,
         extra-system experience (updates to LLMs/their implied
         ‘knowledge bases’) and Manually or semi-manually entered
         knowledge,e.g.,new equipment spec sheets,best practices in
         product manual.  The knowledge is used to inform its analysis,
         decision-making, and execution processes.  Over time, the
         Network AI agent can expand its knowledge through machine
         learning, incorporating new data and experiences to improve its
         performance.  For example, it learns which configurations are
         optimal for specific scenarios or how to respond most
         effectively to particular types of network incidents
         [I-D.ietf-nmop-network-incident-yang].

   *  Analysis:  The Network AI agent continuously analyzes vast amounts
         of network data from various sources, including network
         telemetry [RFC9232] and external feeds, and identify the gap
         between user intent and the existing network status.  By
         integrating Network digital twin
         [I-D.irtf-nmrg-network-digital-twin-arch] with Network AI agent
         and leveraging machine learning and other data analytics
         techniques, it also identifies network fault, problem,
         incident, anomaly and perform data driven intelligent analysis
         such as service impact analysis, and so on.  Their distinction
         is further discussed in [I-D.ietf-nmop-terminology].

   *  Decision:  Based on the intent and network analysis, AI makes
         informed decisions.  By integrating network digital twin
         [I-D.irtf-nmrg-network-digital-twin-arch] and AI, the
         intelligence decisions making can be realized.  These decisions
         could involve dynamically adjusting network parameters, e.g.,
         rerouting traffic to avoid congestion.  The decision-making
         process is driven by predefined policies, real-time data
         analysis, and AI models (e.g., LLMs) that enable the Network AI
         agent to choose the best course of action to meet the specified
         intent.  Network AI agent may also verify the correctness of
         the decision outcome by performing some network simulation or
         validation process.

   *  Awareness:  Awareness is achieved through real-time monitoring and
         data collection.  The Network AI agent maintains a
         comprehensive visibility of the network, enabling it to make
         context-aware decisions.  Network operators can also use the
         awareness understand the exact cause of specific network issues
         and achieve closed-loop decision-making.

   *  Execution:  Once a decision is made, the Network AI agent executes
         the necessary actions to implement it.  This could involve,
         e.g., sending configuration to network controllers or network
         devices through NETCONF/RESTCONF protocols.  The execution is
         carried out in a controlled and precise manner to ensure that
         the network behaves as intended without causing disruptions.
         The Network AI agent also verifies that the executed actions
         have the desired effect and makes the proper adjustments if
         needed.

5.  Architecture Design

5.1.  Overall Architecture

   Figure 2 provides the overall architecture for integrating Network
   Digital Twin and Network AI Agent System.  The components and
   functional interfaces are discussed in Section 5.2 and Section 5.3,
   respectively.  The use cases described in Section 7 show how
   different components are used selectively to provide different
   services.  It is important to understand that the relationships and
   interfaces shown between components in this figure are illustrative
   of some of the common or likely interactions; however, this figure
   does not preclude other interfaces and relationships as necessary to
   realize specific functionality.

                         Network Digital Twin

5.2.  Functional Components

   This section describes the functional components shown as boxes in
   Figure 2.  The interactions between those components, the functional
   interfaces, are described in Section 5.3.

5.2.1.  Network Applications

   Various network applications at the service level can effectively run
   over a AI driven Network operation platform to to implement either
   conventional or innovative network operations, with low cost and less
   service impact on real networks.

   A network application may be a software tool that a user uses to make
   requests to the network to set up specific services such as end-to-
   end connections or scheduled bandwidth reservations or NOC
   Application /Service AI Agent Application that is responsible for
   monitoring, managing, and maintaining the health, performance, and
   availability of complex networks.

   Network applications make requests that need to be addressed by the
   AI driven network.  Such requests are exchanged through a northbound
   intent interface (e.g., Restful API, Natural Language Programming
   Interface(NLPI),A2A, A2A-T), so that they can be applied by multi-
   agent system at the appropriate twin instance(s).

5.2.2.  Autonomous Domain

   An autonomous domain is a self-governing network that integrates NDT
   and AI driven capabilities to achieve autonomous network management.
   It comprises the following sub-components.

5.2.2.1.  Multi-Agent System

   Multi-Agent system acts as the smart brain of the Autonomous Domain,
   which is responsible for conducting AI-based analysis and making
   decisions regarding network management operations.  It usually
   comprises a Network AI Agent and one or multiple task agents.

   The Network AI Agent coordinates cross-task-agent collaboration,
   aligns tasks with user intent, and supervises the task execution of
   each task agent.  And task agents are designed to perform specific
   functionalities, they could be scenario-oriented and classified
   according to the function they perform.  Task Agents can adapt to new
   circumstances through access to evolving knowledge and reasoning,
   planning.  It leverages the inference of LLM, the simulation of
   Network Digital Twin, and the contextual and domain-specific
   knowledge provided by Knowledge Base to accomplish specific network
   operation task.  Some ongoing efforts (MCP [MCP], A2A [A2A]) in the
   industry may help with multi-agents coordination.

5.2.2.2.  Agent Gateway

   The Agent Gateway, which serves as a central management hub, provides
   essential services for the Multi-Agent System, including agent
   registration/discovery, authentication, and knowledge base.

5.2.2.2.1.  Registration

   AI Agents need to first discover each other and understand their
   capabilities to collaborate.  Agent Registration manages the process
   by which new agents could join the system, making them discoverable
   and available.  Each Agent instance submits its own metadata
   information including URI, supported authentication methods, and
   capabilities to the Agent Registry.  And the consumer Agent (e.g.,
   the Network AI Agent or task agent) could query or subscribe to the
   Agent Registry to find appropriate Agents for task execution.

   [A2A] implements Agent Registration by providing the Agent Card
   mechanism to ensure Agents from different vendors can register and
   discover other Agents they need.

5.2.2.2.2.  Security

   Security component enforces trusted inter-Agent communication by
   verifying the identity of AI Agents.  Some existing authentication
   methods such as OAuth 2.0, allow to issue each AI Agent its own
   authentication credentials to establish trusted communication.

   Standardized protocols like TLS (Transport Level Security) could be
   leveraged to protect sensitive data exchanged between AI Agents.

   It is also worth noting that once authenticated, authorization
   defines the specific tools and data an agent can access, which often
   using a Least Privilege access control method.  It is also
   recommended to log every Agent decision and tooling call to maintain
   audit trail.

5.2.2.3.  Observability

   Observability component can collect logs, metrics and traces for each
   agents within autonomous domain from the Agent Gateway and provides
   end to end visibility into progress, failures, and network
   performance such as latency.

   In addition, it can also make sure every action is governed by
   declarative policy, logged, and traceable for operational
   integrity,e.g., it can discern whether a human-in-the-loop approved
   an action or if the agent acted autonomously.

5.2.2.3.1.  Knowledge Base

   The Knowledge Base serves as a crucial repository of information
   within the architecture.  It enables the injection of expert
   knowledge and and chain of thoughts, provides the necessary knowledge
   and memory that helps Agents make more accurate and practive context-
   aware decisions.  It also helps mitigate the hallucination problems
   that can arise in large-scale models, which enhances the accuracy of
   task execution.  Additionally, the Knowledge Base plays a key role in
   providing the data needed for techniques like Retrieval-Augmented
   Generation (RAG), which further boosts the system's ability to
   generate reliable and relevant outputs.

   In case of coupling MCP [MCP] with the nework management system, the
   new knowledge also can be used to support modification of the
   currently operating automation Closed Loop, such as: - Choice of
   tools (data, analytics, algorithms/decision processes, closed loops)
   - Orchestration of tools

5.2.2.4.  Network Digital Twin

   A Network Digital Twin provides an enhanced and optimized solution in
   the face of increasing network and business types, scale, and
   complexity.  It simulates the behavior, performance, and
   characteristics of the actual network, which could help in validation
   and testing scenarios, analyzing and predicting network behavior
   without affecting the real physical network.

   As described in Section 7 of
   [I-D.irtf-nmrg-network-digital-twin-arch], the core functional
   components of an Network Digital Twin includes Data Repository,
   Service Mapping Models, and a Network Digital Twin Management
   component.  The Network Digital Twin collects the real-time
   operational and instrumentation data from network through the
   appropriate real network-facing input interfaces, and it delivers NDT
   services through appropriate application-facing output interfaces,
   which is the interfaces to Network AI Agent(s) in Figure 2.

5.2.2.5.  Physical Network

   This is the actual hardware and infrastructure that makes up the
   network, which includes a set of network devices and wiring.  In a
   physical network, Network Elements (NEs) with Lightweight AI
   [I-D.irtf-nmrg-ai-challenges] or AI Agent may also achieve some local
   close loop without relying on human intervention.  It is also
   possible for Lightweight AI or AI Agent to coordinate with other AI
   Agent(s) to enhance the automation and efficiency of network
   operations.  The Network Leightweight AI models could be trained,
   validated, deployed, and executed on Network Elements, and further
   refined (e.g., model re-training) through monitoring and continuous
   optimization based on feedback from LLM.

5.3.  Functional Interfaces

   This section describes the interfaces between functional components
   that might be externalized in an implementation allowing the
   components to be distributed across platforms.  Where existing
   protocols might provide all or most of the necessary capabilities,
   they are noted.

   As noted in Section 5.1, it is important to understand that the
   relationships and interfaces shown between components in Figure 2 are
   illustrative of some of the common or likely interactions; however,
   this figure and the descriptions in the subsections below do not
   preclude other interfaces and relationships as necessary to realize
   specific functionality.  Thus, some of the interfaces described below
   might not be visible as specific relationships in Figure 2, but they
   can nevertheless exist.

5.3.1.  Human in the Loop

   The architecture allows human experts to monitor, guide, approve, or
   intervene in the AI driven network operations.  Human may provide
   guidance and make critical decisions when necessary.  By involving
   human in the process, the architecture can leverage their insights
   and experience, ensuring AI actions align with organizational goals.

   Human in the loop is also helpful to provide a safeguard for complex
   or sensitive decisions, where human judgement is essential to avoid
   potential errors or ethical dilemmas.

   This typically uses natural lanaguage as the primary mode of
   interaction, a chat platform that allows for conversational
   interaction with AI Agents can be leveraged.  In some scenarios,
   operators may use structured format for strategy injection via
   workflows.  Protocols like A2A [A2A], and RESTful API can be
   leveraged.

5.3.2.  Application to Network AI Agent Interface

   Intent based Network Management helps in delivering application
   requests to the AI Driven network operation platform and exposing the
   various platform capabilities to network applications.

   Standardized protocols and interfaces facilitate smooth communication
   between applications and AI driven network operation platform and
   ensures different systems from various vendors can work together
   seamlessly.  The interfaces between Network applications and Network
   AI Agent can adopt IG1453 Agent to Agent Protocol for Telecoms (A2A-
   T) [A2A-T] specified by TM Forum.

5.3.3.  Network AI Agent to Task AI Agent Interface (Single Autonomous
        Domain)

   This interface governs the coordination and task delegation within
   the Multi-Agent System of a single Autonomous Domain.  The Network AI
   Agent, acting as the principal coordinator, uses this interface to
   decompose high-level goals into specific tasks and assign them to
   specialized Task Agents (e.g., for configuration generation or fault
   diagnosis).  It facilitates communication for task assignment,
   progress monitoring, and result aggregation.  This coordination can
   be implemented using protocols like [A2A-T].

5.3.4.  Network AI Agent to Network AI Agent Interface (Cross Autonomous
        Domain)

   This interface enables collaboration and information exchange between
   Network AI Agents residing in different Autonomous Domains.  It is
   essential for scenarios requiring end-to-end service assurance or
   coordinated optimization across multi-domain networks.  Through this
   interface, Network AI Agents can negotiate resource allocation, share
   summarized domain-specific insights (while preserving detail
   isolation for privacy and scalability), and coordinate actions to
   fulfill cross-domain objectives.  Standardized protocols like A2A-T
   [A2A-T], designed for agent interoperability in telecommunication
   area, are candidate technologies for implementing this cross-domain
   interface, ensuring secure and reliable interaction between
   autonomous systems from different administrative domains.

5.3.5.  Network AI Agent/Task AI Agent to Agent Gateway Interface

   The interface between Multi-Agent System and Agent Gateway serves as
   the management bridge which encompasses a set of services designed to
   manage the lifecycle, security, and collaborative capabilities of the
   AI Agents.

   Registration handles Agent onboarding, lifecycle tracking (e.g.,
   heartbeat monitoring, status updates), and capability-based Agent
   discovery.  Interfaces like RESTful APIs with structural schema for
   AI Agents metadata description could be leveraged.  Protocols like
   A2A [A2A] Agent card mechanism may also be used to ensure
   interoperability among different Agent vendors.  It is also worth
   noting that message queue mechanisms such as Kafka could also be a
   candidate interface for asynchronous communications for agent
   registration and discovery.

   Authentication ensures trusted inter-Agent communication by verifying
   the identity of AI Agents and enforcing security policies throughout
   their interaction.  Protocols like Transport Layer Security (TLS)
   could be leveraged for in-transit data Protection.  While OAuth 2.0
   and OpenID Connect are increasingly used to authenticate AI Agents.

   The interface between AI Agent and Knowledge Base is specified in
   Section 5.3.7.

5.3.6.  Network AI Agent to Network Digital Twin Interface

   The interface between Multi-Agent System and Network Digital Twin are
   the application-facing interface as defined in
   [I-D.irtf-nmrg-network-digital-twin-arch].  Furthermore, the Model
   Context Protocol (MCP) [MCP] can be leveraged to standardize this
   interaction, enabling the NDT to expose its simulation and analysis
   capabilities as a set of discoverable "tools" that the AI Agent can
   dynamically invoke.  This MCP-based approach facilitates seamless
   integration and richer contextual exchange between the Agent and the
   NDT.

5.3.7.  Network AI Agent to Knowledge Base Interface

   Knowledge Base service provides contextual data and insights to
   enhance the decision-making accuracy of the Multi-Agent System.

   Interfaces such as Cypher or SPARQL with schema-defind data models
   (e.g., LPG or RDF for knowledge representation) allow efficient
   retrieval and updates.  Other high-throughput interfaces such as gRPC
   or RESTful API can be the candidate for synchronous semantic search
   queries.  For large-scale knowledge operations, asynchronous data
   message systems (e.g., Kafka) can also be employed for data ingestion
   and real-time knowledge synchronization across distributed Agents.

   Additionally, the Model Context Protocol (MCP) [MCP] could also serve
   as a standardized interface for AI Agents to dynamically access and
   utilize a wide range of tools and data sources provided by the
   Knowledge Base.  It enables the Knowledge Base to expose contextual
   information, expert rules, and external data as "tools" that Agents
   can invoke, significantly enhancing their reasoning and problem-
   solving capabilities.

5.3.8.  Task AI Agent to Physical Network Interface

5.3.8.1.  Data Collection

   Data Collection interface is responsible for gathering data from the
   physical network through various different tools and methods (e.g.,
   IPFIX [RFC7011], YANG-push [RFC8639],[RFC8641], BMP [RFC7854], and
   MCP [MCP]).  It collects various types of network data including
   configuration data, operational data, network topology, routing data,
   logs, and trace on management plane, control plane, and forwarding
   plane as needed.  The collected data is fed into the Network Digital
   Twin and Network AI Agent(s) to provide with up-to-date information
   about the current state of the physical network.

5.3.8.2.  Configuration

   Once network decisions are made and confirmed, the Multi-Agent System
   performs specific actions to the physical network, e.g., modify
   specific configuration on network controllers or network devices
   through protocols like NETCONF [RFC6241] , RESTCONF [RFC8040], MCP
   [MCP].  It is the component that makes the planned control and
   management changes a reality in the real physical network.

5.3.8.3.  Lightweight AI and Large AI Model Collaboration Interface

   Collaboration between small AI model and large AI model is also
   designed to be supported by this interface.

   In the past, we only support AI and machine learning technologies at
   the network level, e.g., we can use collected various different
   network data to provide network analysis and generate network
   insight.  With more intelligence introduced into the network element,
   more GPU/NPU resource can be allocated for AI inference, this make
   collaboration between large AI model and small AI model possible.

   Large AI models can provide basic logical reasoning and generalized
   analytical decision-making capabilities While specialized small AI
   models can provide efficient problem-solving capabilities in
   specialized areas.  The synergy between the two allows the AI agent
   to combine both multitasking generalization capabilities and domain
   expertise, thus minimizing the reliance on human intervention in the
   network management process.

   On one hand, we can use accumulated field engineering expertise to
   train large AI model into one foundation model for fault management
   AI agent, On the other hand, we can deploy small AI model, leverage
   hardware resource or chipset resource in the intelligent network
   element to collect more fine granularity data or provide local
   processing for Collected data and summary report generation, Trend
   prediction, etc.  With collaboration between large AI model and small
   AI model, we can allow Network AI Agent within the Network controller
   interact with network element and has more quick response to network
   change.

   This collaboration, facilitated by APIs or agent communication
   protocols like A2A [A2A], combines the generalization power of large
   models with the efficiency and low-latency of specialized small
   models, leading to quicker and more context-aware responses to
   network change.

5.3.9.  Feedback-driven Improvement Interface

   The architecture should incorporate mechanism for continuous
   improvement based on feedback.  This includes collecting data on AI
   decisions, network performance, and user feedback to identify areas
   for enhancement.  By analyzing the feedback, the system can adapt and
   optimize its operations over time, leading to better performance and
   more accurate decision-making.  For example, if a Network AI Agent
   fails to accurately identify the exact cause of a network incident,
   the relevant records can be submitted as negative samples to the LLM
   which provides inference services, this allows the LLM to be trained
   on these negative samples for optimization.

   This interface is implemented through a combination of system
   interfaces that collect, process, and apply feedback.  Operational
   feedback—including the outcomes of AI decisions, network state
   metrics—is collected as structured data via system logging streams
   (e.g., in JSON format) and message queues (e.g., Kafka).  This data
   is then consumed by analytics components and machine learning
   platforms through APIs (e.g., RESTful, gRPC) to refine AI models, for
   instance, by using failure records as negative samples for fine-
   tuning.  Subsequently, optimized models and updated knowledge are
   deployed back into the runtime system via model serving and
   configuration management interfaces, closing the improvement loop.

6.  AI Driven Network Operations: Relationship Between Characteristics
    and Functional Components

   The architecture in Figure 2 provides a concrete implementation
   framework to realize the six key characteristics of AI-driven network
   operations described in Section 4.  Each characteristic is directly
   supported by specific functional components within the Autonomous
   Domain.  The following clarifies how the architecture operationalizes
   these characteristics:

   *  Intent:  The Network Applications Layer conveys a high-level user
         intent via northbound interfaces.  The Network AI Agent
         interprets this intent and translates it into actionable
         network operation tasks to each task Agent.

   *  Knowledge:  The Knowledge Base in Agent Gateway serves as the
         central repository for domain-specific knowledge, expert rules,
         and historical data.  It provides the necessary context and
         long/short memory to support accurate decision-making by task
         Agents.

   *  Analysis:  The AI Agent in Multi-Agent System performs intelligent
         analysis using data and tools.  It leverages the Network
         Digital Twin to simulate and validate scenarios, enabling data-
         driven insights and gap analysis between intent and current
         network state.

   *  Decision:  The AI Agent in Multi-Agent System makes informed
         decisions based on its analysis results.  It utilizes the
         Network Digital Twin for risk-free validation before finalizing
         decisions.  The decision may be sent to human operators for
         confirmation before actions are taken.

   *  Awareness:  The AI Agent in Multi-Agent System gathers data from
         the Physical Network, it may also fetch data from the Network
         Digital Twin which maintains a dynamic, virtual representation
         of Physical Network.  Together, they provide comprehensive
         network visibility and context-aware awareness.

   *  Execution: ：The AI Agent in Multi-Agent System implements
      validated decisions by applying configurations or control actions
      to the Physical Network via southbound interfaces such as NETCONF,
      RESTCONF, or Model Context Protocol [MCP].

7.  AI Driven Network Operations: A collection of Use Cases

   Network AI Agent could help in the following phases which are usually
   mentioned in network management:

   *  Network Planning and Design: includes the understanding of user
      intent, generation of solutions, and simulation for decision-
      making.

   *  Service Deployment: includes the construction of the physical
      network, as well as intent understanding, pre-deployment
      simulation, automated configuration, post-deployment validation,
      and other capabilities to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of
      network configuration for service deployment.

   *  Network Monitoring and Troubleshooting: includes intent
      monitoring, issues identification, solution generation, evaluation
      and decision-making, solution implementation, and service
      validation.

   *  Network Change and Optimization: involves the design, evaluation,
      decision-making, implementation, and validation of network
      configuration changes or optimizations to improve network
      operation efficiency.

   In all phases and use cases, after the Agent performs specific
   action, it always continuously monitors the network by data
   collection.  Based on the result of network running analysis and user
   explicit feedback, it may adjust and optimize the management strategy
   if necessary.

7.1.  Multi-Agent Collaboration on Network Configuration Change

   Network configuration changes are needed in scenarios such as
   optimizing network or service performance, provisioning new network
   services, or resolving network incidents/faults.

     Figure 3: Intent Based Network Configuration Change Usage Example

   Network configuration change leveraging Network AI Agent and Network
   Digital Twin may experience the following typical steps:

   Step 1:  The network operator inputs the intent of network
      configuration change into the Network AI Agent using natural
      language.  The network operator may simply explain the objectives
      and requirements of the changes.

   Step 2:  Network AI Agent first verifies the identity of the user
      requesting the change and checks the user's permissions to make
      certain types of network changes against predefined rules or
      policies.  It then understands and parses the initial intent of
      the request, by leveraging the powerful knowledge and reasoning
      capabilities of LLM and decompose the tasks into configuration
      generation task, configuration distribution task, configuration
      validation task and assign to corresponding task agents.
      Configuration generation Task Agent first generates initial
      suggestions for specific network configuration update, which may
      include multiple possible network configuration change plans if
      possible.

   Step 3:  Network AI Agent further communicates with the Configuration
      Validation task agent and Network Digital Twin task agent to
      validate the suggested configuration change, including the syntax
      and semantics of the configuration, verification of effected
      application and resources.  The network digital Twin task agent
      may generate a report indicating the validation result, and
      suggested configuration fix when the validation fails after
      network simulation leveraging the current physical network
      operational state.

   Step 4:  Network AI Agent may generate a configuration change plan
      and submit to the network operator for approval.  Based on the
      feedback from the operator, Network AI Agent then further decides
      whether to optimize the change plan or deliver the plan to the
      Configuration Distribution task agent to conduct the physical
      network configuration change.  The configuration distribution task
      agent may further communicate with resource allocation task agent
      to obtain network resource (e.g.,vlan, IP subnet) allocated by
      resource allocation task agent.

        Figure 4: Intent based Network Troubleshooting Usage Example

   The network operator inputs the intent of network configuration
   change into the Network AI Agent using natural language.  Network AI
   Agent could plan and decompose network troubleshooting tasks and
   coordinate with fault identification task agent, fault diagnosis task
   agent, fault repair task agent and fault prediction task agent to
   assist in network troubleshooting in the following significant
   aspects:

   *  Fault Identification:  Network AI Agent coordinates with fault
         identification task agent continuously monitors and aggregates
         data from various sources, the comprehensive data collection
         provides a holistic view of the network operational state.  By
         analyzing the real-time data, fault identification task Agent
         could detect network anomalies swiftly, which enables the
         prompt identification of potential issues before they escalate
         into major faults, minimizing downtime or service disruptions.
         In some cases, the Leightweight AI located in the Network
         Element may handle some simple fault identification tasks
         (e.g., optical module fault automatic identification) to
         enhance the awareness, while the fault identification task
         agent and LLM could leverage their powerful processing
         capabilities to analyze the time-domain data collected from the
         optical module.

   *  Fault Diagnosis:  Once a fault is identified, Network AI Agent
         coordinate with fault diagnosis task agent to delve into
         diagnosing the exact cause, fault diagnosis task agent may also
         invoke some existing operations such as "incident-diagnose" RPC
         defined in [I-D.ietf-nmop-network-incident-yang].  By
         correlating symptoms and/or applying AI models trained on
         historical data, fault diagnosis task agent can narrow down the
         potential causes and pinpoint the exact cause, which
         accelerates the diagnosis process and reduces the time needed
         to address the issue.

   *  Fault Repair:  After diagnosing the fault, Network AI Agent can
         coordinate with fault repair task agent to generate targeted
         repair solutions.  These solutions range from specific
         configuration adjustments to more complex fixes (e.g., hardware
         replacement).  Fault Repair task Agent would also communicate
         with the Network Digital Twin task agent to simulate the
         proposed repair solutions and get feedback from the Network
         Digital Twin task agent.  In advanced setups, fault repair task
         agent may automatically execute these repairs, ensuring quick
         restoration of normal operations and enhancing the overall
         reliability and efficiency of network management.  But the
         fault repair task agent may also first present the fault
         details and repair advice to the network operator for review,
         and proceed to carry out the repair task once it is confirmed.

   *  Fault Prediction  As an advanced enhancement of fault management
         capabilities, fault prediction aims to reduce network risks
         through proactive management that prevents problems before they
         occur.  Before a fault actually occurs, the fault prediction
         task agent can coordiante with network digital twin task agent
         to construct a dynamic simulation model by collecting real-time
         multi-dimensional operational state data, including network
         topology, traffic load, and device performance indicators.
         Based on the network data, the fault predication task agent
         uses large models and machine learning algorithms (such as
         time-series prediction models and anomaly detection models) to
         reason and analyze potential faults—for example, predicting the
         risk of physical link interruption based on optical cable
         signal attenuation data.  Furthermore, the fault prediction
         task Agent generates recommended operations to avoid faults and
         validates them through simulation in the network digital twin
         task agent, thereby achieving predictive maintenance of the
         network.

         Figure 5: Intent based Network Optimization Usage Example

   Network optimization is often introduced due to the Network AI
   Agent's awareness of some potential network faults or anomalies
   through continuously monitoring of network operational state, e.g.,
   AI models may predicts network congestion by analyzing historical and
   real-time network traffic data.  It may also be triggered by the
   network operator actively inputting the network optimization intent.

   Based on the analysis of network data and user's intent (if any),
   Network AI Agent collaborate with Optimization Solution Generation
   Task Agent to propose network optimization strategies.  For instance,
   once the network congestion sometime in the future is predicted, it
   may proactively optimize the network configuration, or suggest
   scaling up to meet specific demands.

   Before the network optimization is conducted, Network AI Agent
   coordinates with the network digital twin task agent to implement and
   evaluate the optimization solution using the Network Digital Twin
   platform.  This may need repeated trials and validations based on
   specific evaluation criteria, before the optimal strategy could be
   selected.  Network AI Agent may also first present the suggested
   network optimization solution to the network operator for review, and
   apply it to the physical network through optimization solution
   distribution task agent after obtaining approval from the network
   operator.

     Figure 6: Intent based Network level Energy Efficiency Management
                               Usage Example

   Network level Energy Efficiency refer to a set of processes used to
   discover a inventory of capabilities, use specific metrics to monitor
   and assess energy consumption of the entire IP+Optical network ,
   operate, and control the use of available energy in an optimized
   manner while achieving the network’s functional and performance
   requirements by improving overall network utilization.

   Multi-Domain AI Agent can work together with network AI Agent in each
   autonomous domain to allow network operators not only see real time
   energy consumption in the network devices of large scale network
   through interaction with the GREEN Network AI Agent, but also allow
   them see

   o which network devices enable energy saving, which devices not,which
   are legacy ones,

   o The total energy consumption changing trend over the time of the
   day, for all network devices,

   o Energy efficiency changing trend over the time of the day for the
   whole network.

   On the other hand, With the end to end observability to energy
   consumption statistics data and energy efficiency statistics data,
   the Network AI Agent in each autonomous domain can collaborate with
   network digital twin to know which part of the network need to be
   adjusted or optimized based on network status change.

        Figure 7: Intent based Network Security Drill Usage Example

   The human operator can work together with the Network AI Agent to
   conduct Network security Drill.  The human operator can instruct the
   Network AI Agent with specific injection policy to work with network
   digital twin help construct a dynamic attack-defense verification
   system in network security drills through NDT and AI reasoning
   capabilities.  The dynamic attack-defense verification system
   comprise dynamic security attack task agent and dynamic security
   defense task agent which are responsible security risk attack task
   and security risk defense task respectively assigned by the network
   AI agent.  The dynamic security attack task agent uses generative AI
   to automatically generate diversified attack paths, models network
   topologies with graph neural networks, covers attack stages such as
   reconnaissance and penetration, and dynamically adjusts strategies
   via reinforcement learning to simulate the adaptive characteristics
   of network attacks.  The virtual range built based on the NDT can 1:1
   map the production environment, supporting simulations of composite
   scenarios like ransomware chain attacks and supply chain attacks —
   such as simulating the entire process of Contivirus laterally
   penetrating to domain controllers through weak passwords.

   During drills, Human operator can instruct the Network AI Agent to
   work with the dynamic security defense task agent to automatically
   deploy virtual environments with vulnerabilities, collect defense
   response data in real time through NDT, and generate attack path
   heatmaps and repair suggestions.  This capability can further verify
   emergency response processes, inject real-time threat intelligence to
   dynamically update drill scenarios, and simulate end-to-end automated
   deployment, vulnerability injection, and real-time analysis of
   security drills, enhancing the proactive verification ability of
   defense systems against real-world threats.

8.  Challenges of Integrating Network Digital Twin and Agentic AI into
    Network Management

   In addition to the research challenges in coupling AI and network
   management specified in [I-D.irtf-nmrg-ai-challenges], this document
   also identifies some challenges that need to be considered when
   integrating agentic AI together with network digital twin for network
   operations.

8.1.  Trust and Security

   Multi-Agent Collaborations and interactions can be break down into 4
   typical scenarios:

   o Human operator-> AI Agent-> APIs/Tools/APIs/LLMs

   In a single-agent scenario, Human operators access services through
   the network management AI agent.  The network management AI agent has
   multiple functions (fault and optimization), and authentication is
   required to prevent users from accessing the optimization function
   interface when they only have fault agent permissions.

   o AI Agent -> API Services

   In a single-agent scenario, the network management AI agent triggers
   tasks automatically based on trace and log information.

   o Human operator-> AI Agent -> multiple AI Agent Multiple agents may
   call each other.  For example, if a faulty agent A calls an
   optimization agent B, authentication is required.

   o External AI Agent ->AI Agent-> APIs/Tools/APIs/LLMs

   External AI agents can directly access the network management AI
   Agent by simulating human operation through interface protocols.  For
   example, a customer AI agent can access the Network AI Agent through
   a northbound interface.

   Ensuring robust security throughout the entire AI-based network
   management architecture is essential to prevent unauthorized access
   and maintain the security of the network infrastructure.  The
   security risk can be break down into the following cases:

   o External system interact with AI agent

   Human Operators or external systems bypass their privileges to
   operate the Network management AI agent

   *  Human operators operate through a network management AI agent, but
      the service scope that the AI agent can handle may exceed the
      user's authorized privileges, leading to unauthorized access.

   o AI Agent Interact with Tools/APIs/LLMs

   *  Interact with Tools/APIs/LLMs with Privilege Escalation

      Since network management AI agents rely on LLM for inference when
      accessing APIs and tools, there is a possibility of malicious
      injection scenarios where the APIs accessed by the agent exceed
      the expected scope.

   *  Interact with Tools/APIs/LLMs without audit

      When an agent interacts with an API or tool, the logs are
      currently recorded as system logs, which cannot distinguish
      between different agents and pose a risk of repudiation.

   o Multiple Agent Collaboration and Communication

   *  Multi-Agent Communication with Privilege Escalation

      When agents communicate with each other via intent communication
      and understanding, there is a cascading permission amplification
      problem, leading to Privilege Escalation.

   *  Interaction with internal AI Agent

      As a microservice, a network management AI agent can be accessed
      by other services or AI agents, which poses a risk of Privilege
      Escalation.

8.2.  Protocols between Agent and Agent/Human operator/Tools

8.2.1.  High Risk Operations

   "network change" in the network management field refers to the
   modification, adjustment, or configuration of physical or logical
   resources in the existing network.  Because these operations directly
   affect the continuity and stability of existing network services,
   even minor unauthorized access or errors can lead to large-scale
   network outages.  In case of high risk operation, the following
   measures should be taken into account.

   o Regardless of whether the initiator of the operation is a human or
   an agent, each network change request must be re-authenticated.

   o For operations involving "bulk deletion" or "core route changes",
   the system must require approval from a second high-privilege account
   before issuing the command or enforcing the policy.

   o High-risk configurations should be tested on a very small scale
   first.  The system should automatically monitor the indicators, and
   if any abnormalities are detected, the configuration should be
   automatically rolled back within milliseconds.

8.2.2.  The timeliness requirement of collaboration

   For real-time network operation and maintenance scenarios with high
   real-time requirements, such as scheduling strategy optimization and
   critical fault repair, the rapid generation of network optimization
   decisions is crucial.  However AI Agents based on large models adopt
   a "Token-based" generation and reasoning approach, which is limited
   by computing power and algorithms, resulting in generally slow
   reasoning speeds.  In addition, the simulation and verification
   process of Network Digital Twin (NDT) further increases decision
   latency, which leads to long end-to-end decision-making time in
   complex scenarios and is difficult to meet the real-time requirements
   of services.

   Also tasks such as fault diagnosis, complaint handling, and user
   experience improvement often have strict time constraints.  For
   example, if a fault is not resolved within a set time, it can trigger
   an escalation of the complaint, requiring efficient collaboration
   among multiple agents.  In addition, In a network management
   environment, you might need agents to subscribe to real-time network
   alarms or telemetry events.  However Google-initiated A2A protocol
   primarily follows a task-oriented "request-response" model and
   doesn't support a native pub/sub or event-driven architecture.

   To improve decision efficiency, continuous efforts are needed in
   lightweight NDT modeling algorithms, optimizing large model reasoning
   frameworks (such as quantization technology and parallel computing),
   and deploying high-performance AI acceleration hardware.

8.2.3.  Collaboration Reliability

   Fault diagnosis and complaint handling in the network management
   field are complex tasks, typically involving 10 to 20+ fields for one
   single message exchange between two AI Agents and requiring a high
   level of expertise.  In addition, Reliable task collaboration is
   incomplete and not sufficient for network management field, e.g.,
   Google-initiated A2A protocol doesn't defined handling strategies for
   task rejection, missing information during task collaboration, and
   failure to achieve task objectives.

   also In network management area, data sources can be diverse and
   heterogeneous, leading to potential issues such as data
   inconsistencies, missing, or outdated data.  Poor-quality data may
   result in inaccurate AI predictions and decisions.  For example, if
   incorrect or outdated network configuration data is provided, the
   model may provide incorrect repair advice when diagnosing network
   incidents or faults, it may suggest checking an non-existing
   interface.  Ensuring that data is properly cleaned, validated, and
   maintained is a significant challenge in providing reliable inputs
   for AI-driven network management.

8.3.  Benchmarking

8.3.1.  Single Agent Benchmarking

   The core of Single Agents assessment lies in its "omnipotence" and
   the quality of its direct interaction with the environment.

   o Task complexity bottleneck

   When dealing with long-term, multi-step tasks, single agents are
   prone to hallucination accumulation and reasoning chain breaks.
   Benchmark tests need to evaluate their persistent logic capabilities
   under context window constraints.

   o Command compliance and control

   The challenge lies in whether the model can strictly follow complex
   system prompts, especially when there are many tool options, which
   can easily lead to tool invocation errors or the omission of some
   instructions.

   o Generalization and memory

   To evaluate how monolithic models can efficiently manage long-term
   memory to handle new tasks without relying on external collaborative
   support.

8.3.2.  Multi-Agent Benchmarking

   The focus of collaborative assessment has shifted from "individual
   capabilities" to "system dynamics":

   o Coordination and communication overhead:

   Multi-agent systems (MAS) involve complex task decomposition and
   allocation (global planning).  Benchmarking needs to measure the
   communication efficiency between agents, alignment consistency, and
   the high latency and cost caused by multi-turn interactions.

   o Error tracing and attribution:

   When the final task fails, it is extremely challenging to accurately
   pinpoint which "role" went wrong or in which round of collaboration
   there was a deviation (failure attribution) due to the presence of
   multiple participants.

   o Swarm intelligence and social emergence:

   It is necessary to assess the dynamics of competition and cooperation
   among intelligent agents, including the existence of systemic risks
   such as information silos, resource waste, or vicious cycles.

9.  Security Considerations

   The security consideration from
   [I-D.irtf-nmrg-network-digital-twin-arch] apply here.  In addition,
   the following architectural risks need to be considered:

   *  Single point of failure: While the architecture provides
      resiliency through its recovery capabilities, the network digital
      twin or Network AI Agent could become a single point of failure if
      not implemented with sufficientc redundancy and fault tolerance.

   *  AI/ML model integrity: If the AI/ML models used by the digital
      twin are compromised or poisoned with bad data, they could begin
      making incorrect or malicious decisions.  Robust checks and
      validation are necessary to ensure the integrity of these models.

   *  Lifecycle security: The entire lifecycle of the network AI agents
      and the network digital twin—from initial deployment and
      configuration to updates and decommissioning—must be secured
      against unauthorized access and manipulation.

10.  IANA Considerations
