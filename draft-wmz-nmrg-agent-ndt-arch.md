--- abstract

A Network Digital Twin (NDT) provides a network emulation tool usable for different purposes
such as scenario planning, impact analysis, and change management. Integrating
a Network Digital Twin into network management together with AI, it allows the network management
activities to take user intent or service requirements as input,
automatically assess, model, and refine optimization strategies under realistic conditions
but in a risk-free environment. Such environment that operates to meet these types of
requirements is said to have AI driven Network Operations.

AI driven Network Operations brings together existing technologies such
as Network Digital Twin and AI which may be seen as the use of a toolbox
of existing components enhanced with a few new elements.

This document describes an architecture for AI driven network
operations and shows how these components work together. It provides a
cookbook of existing technologies to satisfy the architecture and realize
intent-based networking to meet the needs of the network service.

# Introduction

The rapid expansion of network scale and the increasing demands on these networks necessitate
of continuous network reconfiguration to better adapt to ever-changing service requirements.

Since network changes are directly related to service operations, any successful change
needs to not only ensure that new services are provisioned smoothly, but also that existing
services are not affected and that no problems are introduced with the new configurations.
Network operators are, therefore, increasingly cautious about making network changes, given that
they need to review the solution design as well as evaluate all change impacts, before making any
change. Then, after the change, they need to perform dialling tests, monitor traffic, and manually
check table entries.

The Network Digital Twin (NDT) {{?I-D.irtf-nmrg-network-digital-twin-arch}} has been proposed as
a mean to provide a network emulation tool for scenario planning, impact analysis, and change
management. Integrating a Network Digital Twin into network management together with AI, it
allows network management activities to dynamically adapt to customer needs, network changes, as
well as to automatically assess, model, and refine optimization strategies under realistic conditions
but in a risk-free environment. An environment that operates to meet these
types of requirements is said to have service-oriented AI for network operations.

Service-oriented AI for network operations provide the following capabilities to applications by
coordinating the components that operate and manage the network:

* Service intent and service assurance work together to ensure that the
  network change or network optimization aligns with business goals and that the services provided
  meet the agreed-upon Service Level Agreements (SLAs).

* Provide network capacity planning and ensure that the network has sufficient capacity
  , resources, and infrastructure to meet current and future demands.

* Provide simulation on fault scenarios, formulate recovery plans, and verify whether the plans
  are applicable and effective so that the service will not be affected during disaster recovery
  drill.

* Support fault and risk detection and provide network health check and network risk check.

* Model the network configuration change and use a virtual topology model to test network changes
  and assess the effect of the network configuration changes on the network.

* Model the protocol operations and interactions among devices in the network and simulate
  specific networking protocols such as IS-IS, OSPF, BGP, SR, etc to understand how they perform
  under different conditions.

* Model traffic flow across the network, including traffic generation, flow control, routing, and
  congestion control and evaluate traffic's impact on network performance.

* Support generation of rectification solutions for potential network risks and provide
  verification on the repair solution in seconds, including loop, address conflict, and security
  policy conflict.

This document describes an architecture for service-oriented AI for network
operations, showing how these components work together. It provides a
cookbook of existing technologies to satisfy the architecture and realize
intent-based networking to meet the needs of applications.

# Introduction of Concepts

## Generative AI and AI Agent

The integration of AI into network operations has marked a significant leap forward in
the pursuit of network automation and intelligence, while generative AI further
enhances the role of AI driven network operations and management. Generative AI is a
subfield of AI that uses generative models such as Large Language Models (LLMs) to
generate new and original content such as text, images, videos, or other forms of data with the
capability to adapt and make decisions to achieve specific goals.

An AI agent refers to a system or program that Large Language Models (LLM)s to interact
with humans (or other AI Agents) for purposes of performing tasks {{I-D.rosenberg-ai-protocols}}.
In the context of network operations and management, Network AI agents are increasingly being designed to
interact with physical world and act upon it based on tools {{Google-Agents-Whitepaper}} and
perform network management tasks such as understanding user intent, generating network configurations,
diagnosing and resolving network incidents {{?I-D.ietf-nmop-network-incident-yang}}. Meanwhile, other SDOs
also try to define terms related to Network AI agent in the context of network operations and management, e.g.,
TM Forum defines Autonomous Agent in {{TMF-1251D}} as one of AN (Autonomous Network) Terminologies.

## Network Digital Twin

The Network Digital Twin is a digital representation that is used in the context
of network. The concept and architecture of the Network Digital Twin are specified
in {{I-D.irtf-nmrg-network-digital-twin-arch}}. Three core functional components
which includes Data Repository component, a Service Mapping Models component,
and an NDT Management component are introduced to characterize the Network Digital
Twin and its reference architecture.

The Network Digital Twin is widely recognized to be useful as an advanced platform
for network emulation, serving as a tool for scenario planning, impact analysis,
and change management. By delivering applications requests to the Network Digital
Twin through standardized interfaces (see
{{Section 9.4 of ?I-D.irtf-nmrg-network-digital-twin-arch}}), the Network Digital
Twin exposes the various capabilities to network applications.

# Characteristics of AI driven Network Operations

AIOPS was first defined by Gartner in 2016, combining "artificial intelligence"
and "IT operations" to describe the application of AI and machine learning to
enhance IT operations. However there is no unified definition for characteristic
of "AI driven network operations" within the networking industry.  Referring to the
characteristics of AIOPS in IT field and the characteristics of networking itself,
this document introduces six key elements (i.e., awareness, decision, analysis,
execution, intent and knowledge) to characterize the AI driven network operation and
its use, as shown in {{ops-arch}}.
They together form a close-loop of network operation and management.

{: #ops-arch title="Six Key Elements to Characterize AI driven network operation" artwork-align="center"}

* Intent:
: Intent is defined as a set of operational goals and outcomes defined in a declarative
  manner without specifying how to achieve or implement them in {{?RFC9315}}. The Network AI Agent
  must accurately interpret and understand the user's high-level business or operational
  objectives, this involves translating declarative requirements into specific network
  instructions, e.g., configurations.

* Knowledge:
: The Network AI agent relies on a knowledge base that includes network policies,
  historical data, expert experience, extra-system experience (updates to LLMs/their implied ‘knowledge bases’)
  and Manually or semi-manually entered knowledge,e.g.,new equipment spec sheets,best practices in product manual.
  The knowledge is used to inform its analysis, decision-making, and execution processes.
  Over time, the Network AI agent can expand its knowledge through machine learning,
  incorporating new data and experiences to improve its performance. For example,
  it learns which configurations are optimal for specific scenarios or how to
  respond most effectively to particular types of network incidents {{?I-D.ietf-nmop-network-incident-yang}}.

* Analysis:
: The Network AI agent continuously analyzes vast amounts of network data from various
  sources, including network telemetry {{?RFC9232}} and external feeds, and identify
  the gap between user intent and the existing network status. By integrating Network digital twin
  {{?I-D.irtf-nmrg-network-digital-twin-arch}} with Network AI agent and leveraging machine learning and other data
  analytics techniques, it also identifies network fault, problem, incident, anomaly and perform data driven
  intelligent analysis such as service impact analysis, and so on. Their distinction is further discussed in
  {{?I-D.ietf-nmop-terminology}}.

* Decision:
: Based on the intent and network analysis, AI makes
  informed decisions. By integrating network digital twin {{?I-D.irtf-nmrg-network-digital-twin-arch}} and AI,
  the intelligence decisions making can be realized. These decisions could involve dynamically adjusting network
  parameters, e.g., rerouting traffic to avoid congestion. The decision-making
  process is driven by predefined policies, real-time data analysis, and AI
  models (e.g., LLMs) that enable the Network AI agent to choose the best course of action
  to meet the specified intent. Network AI agent may also verify the correctness of the decision
  outcome by performing some network simulation or validation process.

* Awareness:
: Awareness is achieved through real-time monitoring and data collection.
  The Network AI agent maintains a comprehensive visibility of the network,
  enabling it to make context-aware decisions. Network operators can also use the
  awareness understand the exact cause of specific network issues and achieve closed-loop
  decision-making.

* Execution:
: Once a decision is made, the Network AI agent executes the necessary actions to implement
  it. This could involve, e.g., sending configuration to network controllers or
  network devices through NETCONF/RESTCONF protocols. The execution is carried out
  in a controlled and precise manner to ensure that the network behaves as intended
  without causing disruptions. The Network AI agent also verifies that the executed actions
  have the desired effect and makes the proper adjustments if needed.

{: #arch title="An Architecture for Integrating Network AI Agent with Network Digital Twin" artwork-align="center"}

## Functional Components

### Application

One of example application is multi-domain orchestrator. Multi-domain orchestrator serves
as the top-level coordinator and manages the interactions across different autonomous domains.
Multi-domain orchestrator may invoke Network Digital Twin to perform functions such as analyze,
diagnose, optimize, control, and emulate as per {{?I-D.irtf-nmrg-network-digital-twin-arch}}.
It also provide means to convey user intent to each autonomous domain through a user-facing
Graphical User Interface (GUI) or machine-to-machine North Bound Interface (NBI).

### Autonomous Domain

An autonomous domain is a self-governing unit that achieves NDT and AI driven network
autonomous management.

#### Network Digital Twin

A Network Digital Twin provides an enhanced and optimized solution in the face of increasing
network and business types, scale, and complexity. It simulates the behavior, performance,
and characteristics of the actual network, which could help in validation and testing
scenarios, analyzing and predicting network behavior without affecting the real physical network.

As described in {{Section 7 of ?I-D.irtf-nmrg-network-digital-twin-arch}}, the core
functional components of an Network Digital Twin includes Data Repository,
Service Mapping Models, and a Network Digital Twin Management component. The
Network Digital Twin collects the real-time operational and instrumentation data
from network through the appropriate real network-facing input interfaces, and it
delivers NDT services through appropriate application-facing output interfaces, which is the interfaces
to Network AI Agent(s) in {{arch}}.

#### Network AI Agent(s)

Network AI Agent(s) act(s) as the smart brain of the Autonomous Domain, which is responsible
for conducting AI-based analysis and making decisions regarding network operations and adapting
to new circumstances through access to evolving knowledge and reasoning, planning.
It leverages the inference of LLM, the simulation of Network Digital Twin, and the
contextual and domain-specific knowledge provided by Knowledge Base to accomplish
specific network operation task.

Agents could be scenario-oriented and classified according to the function they perform.
It is also possible for multiple Agents to collaborate in some scenarios.
Multi-Agents management is needed to handle the agent instance lifecycle
(e.g., deployment, update, and retirement of Network AI Agent), Agent registration,
Agent discovery, and so on. Some ongoing efforts (MCP {{MCP}}, A2A {{A2A}}) in the
industry may help with multi-agents coordination.

#### Knowledge Base

The Knowledge Base serves as a crucial repository of information within the
architecture. It enables the injection of expert knowledge and and chain of thoughts,
provides the necessary knowledge and memory that helps AI Agent(s) make more accurate and
practive context-aware decisions. It also helps mitigate the hallucination problems that
can arise in large-scale models, which enhances the accuracy of task execution.
Additionally, the Knowledge Base plays a key role in providing the data needed
for techniques like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which further boosts
the system's ability to generate reliable and relevant outputs.

In case of coupling MCP with the nework management system, the new knowledge also can be used to
support modification of the currently operating automation Closed Loop, such as:
- Choice of tools (data, analytics, algorithms/decision processes, closed loops)
- Orchestration of tools

#### Data Collection

Data Collection component is responsible for gathering data from the physical network
through various different tools and methods (e.g., IPFIX {{?RFC7011}}, YANG-push
  {{?RFC8639}},{{?RFC8641}}, BMP {{?RFC7854}}).
It collects various types of network data including configuration data, operational data,
network topology, routing data, logs, and trace on management plane, control plane, and
forwarding plane as needed. The collected data is fed into the Network Digital Twin
and Network AI Agent(s) to provide with up-to-date information about the current state of
the physical network.

#### Execution

Once network decisions are made and confirmed, the Execution component performs
specific actions to the physical network, e.g., modify specific configuration on
network controllers or network devices through protocols like NETCONF {{?RFC6241}}
and RESTCONF {{?RFC8040}}. It is the component that makes the planned control and
management changes a reality in the real physical network.

### Physical Network

This is the actual hardware and infrastructure that makes up the network, which
includes a set of network devices and wiring. In a physical network, Network Elements (NEs)
with Lightweight AI {{?I-D.irtf-nmrg-ai-challenges}} may also achieve some local close loop without relying on external AI or
human intervention. It is also possible for the Leightweight AI to coordinate with
AI Agent(s) to enhance the automation and efficiency of network operations. The Network
Leightweight AI models could be trained, validated, deployed, and executed on Network Elements,
and further refined (e.g., model re-training) through monitoring and continuous optimization based on feedback from LLM.

## Architecture Requirements

There are a couple of key requirements of the architecture to integrate
Network Digital Twin with service-oriented AI which are crucial in
ensuring the proposed architecture can handle the complex and dynamic network scenarios
for network operations and management.

### Human-in-the-loop

This allows human experts to provide guidance and make critical decisions when necessary.
By involving human in the process, the architecture can leverage their insights and
experience, ensuring AI actions align with organizational goals.

Human-in-the-loop is also helpful to provide a safeguard for complex or sensitive
decisions, where human judgement is essential to avoid potential errors or ethical dilemmas.

### Interoperability via Open Standards

Standardized protocols and interfaces facilitate smooth communication and ensures
different systems and devices from various vendors can work together seamlessly.
The interfaces between Network AI Agent(s) and Network Digital Twin are the application-facing
interfaces as defined in {{?I-D.irtf-nmrg-network-digital-twin-arch}}.
There are some ongoing efforts that are working on the standardization of Network AI Agent
communication {{?I-D.rosenberg-ai-protocols}}.

### Feedback-driven Improvement

The architecture should incorporate mechanism for continuous improvement based on
feedback. This includes collecting data on AI decisions, network performance,
and user feedback to identify areas for enhancement. By analyzing the feedback,
the system can adapt and optimize its operations over time, leading to better
performance and more accurate decision-making. For example, if a Network AI Agent fails
to accurately identify the exact cause of a network incident, the relevant records
can be submitted as negative samples to the LLM which provides inference services,
this allows the LLM to be trained on these negative samples for optimization.
Feedback-driven improvement also enables the architecture to evolve with changing
network conditions and requirements.

### Scalability and Flexibility

The architecture must be designed to scale efficiently to accommodate growing
network demands and increasing data volumes. It should also be flexible enough
to adapt to new network scenarios and operational requirements. This means that
components should be modular, allowing for easy addition or modification of
functionality without disrupting the entire system. Scalability and flexibility
ensure that the architecture remains effective and relevant in the face of evolving
network challenges.

## Collaboration between small AI model and large AI model

The architecture must be designed to support collaboration between small AI model and
large AI model.

In the past, we only support AI and machine learning technologies at the network level,
e.g., we can use collected various different network data to provide network analysis and
generate network insight.

With more intelligence introduced into the network element, more GPU/NPU resource can be
allocated for AI inference, this make collaboration between large AI model
And small AI model become possible. 

Large AI models can provide basic logical reasoning and generalized analytical decision-making
capabilities While specialized small AI models can provide efficient problem-solving capabilities
in specialized areas.  The synergy between the two allows the AI agent to combine both multitasking
generalization capabilities and domain expertise, thus minimizing the reliance on human intervention
in the network management process.

On one hand, we can use accumulated field engineering expertise to train large AI model into one foundation
model for fault management AI agent, On the other hand, we can deploy small AI model, leverage hardware
resource or chipset resource in the intelligent network element to collect more fine granularity data or provide
local processing for Collected data and summary report generation, Trend prediction, etc.
With collaboration between large AI model and small AI model, we can allow Network AI Agent within the Network
controller interact with network element and has more quick response to network change.



# AI Driven Network Operation: A collection of Use Cases

Network AI Agent could help in the following phases which are usually mentioned in network management:

* Network Planning and Design: includes the understanding of user intent,
         generation of solutions, and simulation for decision-making.
* Service Deployment: includes the construction of the physical network,
         as well as intent understanding, pre-deployment simulation, automated configuration,
         post-deployment validation, and other capabilities to enhance the efficiency
         and accuracy of network configuration for service deployment.
* Network Monitoring and Troubleshooting: includes intent monitoring, issues
         identification, solution generation, evaluation and decision-making, solution
         implementation, and service validation.
* Network Change and Optimization: involves the design, evaluation, decision-making,
         implementation, and validation of network configuration changes or optimizations
         to improve network operation efficiency.

In all phases and use cases, after the Agent performs specific action, it always
continuously monitors the network by data collection. Based on the result of network
running analysis and user explicit feedback, it may adjust and optimize the
management strategy if necessary.

## Network Configuration Change

Network configuration changes are needed in scenarios such as optimizing network
or service performance, provisioning new network services, or resolving network incidents/faults.
Network configuration change leveraging AI and Network Digital Twin may experience the following typical steps:

Step 1:
:  The network operator inputs the intent of network configuration change into the
   Network AI Agent using natural language. The network operator may simply explain the
   objectives and requirements of the changes.

Step 2:
: Network AI Agent first verifies the identity of the user requesting the change and checks the user's
  permissions to make certain types of network changes against predefined rules
  or policies. It then understands and parses the initial intent of the request,
  and leverages the powerful knowledge and reasoning capabilities of LLM to generate
  initial suggestions for specific network configuration update, which may include
  multiple possible network configuration change plans if possible.

Step 3:
: Network AI Agent communicates with the Network Digital Twin to validate the suggested
  configuration change, including the syntax and semantics of the configuration,
  verification of effected application and resources. The network digital Twin
  may generate a report indicating the validation result, and suggested
  configuration fix when the validation fails after network simulation leveraging
  the current physical network operational state.

Step 4:
: Network AI Agent may generate a configuration change plan and submit to the network operator
  for approval. Based on the feedback from the operator, Network AI Agent then further decides
  whether to optimize the change plan or deliver the plan to the Execution component
  to conduct the physical network configuration change.

## Network Troubleshooting

Network AI Agent could assist in network troubleshooting in the following significant aspects:

* Fault Identification:
: Network AI Agent continuously monitors and aggregates data from various sources, the
  comprehensive data collection provides a holistic view of the network operational
  state. By analyzing the real-time data, Network AI Agent could detect network
  anomalies swiftly, which enables the prompt identification of potential issues
  before they escalate into major faults, minimizing downtime or service disruptions.
  In some cases, the Leightweight AI located in the Network Element may handle some
  simple fault identification tasks (e.g., optical module fault automatic identification)
  to enhance the awareness, while the Network AI Agent and LLM could leverage their powerful
  processing capabilities to analyze the time-domain data collected from the optical module.

* Fault Diagnosis:
: Once a fault is identified, Network AI Agent delves into diagnosing the exact cause, it
  may also invoke some existing operations such as "incident-diagnose" RPC defined
  in {{?I-D.ietf-nmop-network-incident-yang}}. By correlating symptoms and/or
  applying AI models trained on historical data, it can narrow down the potential
  causes and pinpoint the exact cause, which accelerates the diagnosis process
  and reduces the time needed to address the issue.

* Fault Repair:
: After diagnosing the fault, Network AI Agent can generate targeted repair solutions.
  These solutions range from specific configuration adjustments to more complex
  fixes (e.g., hardware replacement). Network AI Agent would also communicate with
  the Network Digital Twin to simulate the proposed repair solutions and get feedback
  from the Network Digital Twin. In advanced setups, Network AI Agent may automatically execute
  these repairs, ensuring quick restoration of normal operations and enhancing
  the overall reliability and efficiency of network management. But it may also
  first present the fault details and repair advice to the network operator for review,
  and proceed to carry out the repair task once it is confirmed.

* Fault Prediction
: As an advanced enhancement of fault management capabilities, fault prediction aims to
  reduce network risks through proactive management that prevents problems before they
  occur. Before a fault actually occurs, the NDT constructs a dynamic simulation model
  by collecting real-time multi-dimensional operational state data, including network
  topology, traffic load, and device performance indicators. Based on the network data,
  AI Agent uses large models and machine learning algorithms (such as time-series
  prediction models and anomaly detection models) to reason and analyze potential
  faults—for example, predicting the risk of physical link interruption based on optical
  cable signal attenuation data. Furthermore, the AI Agent generates recommended operations
  to avoid faults and validates them through simulation in the NDT, thereby achieving
  predictive maintenance of the network.

## Network Optimization

Network optimization is often introduced due to the Network AI Agent's awareness of some potential
network faults or anomalies through continuously monitoring of network operational
state, e.g., AI models may predicts network congestion by analyzing historical
and real-time network traffic data. It may also be triggered by the network operator
actively inputting the network optimization intent.

Based on the analysis of network data and user's intent (if any), AI Agent proposes
network optimization strategies. For instance, once the network congestion sometime
in the future is predicted, it may proactively optimize the network configuration,
or suggest scaling up to meet specific demands.

Before the network optimization is conducted, Network AI Agent implements and evaluates
the optimization solution using the Network Digital Twin. This may need repeated
trials and validations based on specific evaluation criteria, before the optimal
strategy could be selected. Network AI Agent may also first present the suggested network
optimization solution to the network operator for review, and apply it to the
physical network after obtaining approval from the network operator.

## Network level Energy Efficiency Management

Network level Energy Efficiency refer to a set of processes used to discover a inventory
of capabilities, use specific metrics to monitor and assess energy consumption of the
network , operate, and control the use of available energy in an optimized manner while
achieving the network’s functional and performance requirements by improving overall network
utilization.

Network level Energy Efficiency allows network operators not only see real time energy
consumption in the network devices of large scale network through interaction with the
GREEN Network AI Agent, but also allow them see

o which network devices enable energy saving, which devices not,which are legacy ones,

o The total energy consumption changing trend over the time of the day, for all network
   devices,

o Energy efficiency changing trend over the time of the day for the whole network.

On the other hand, With the better observability to energy consumption statistics data
and energy efficiency statistics data, the Network AI Agent can know which part of the network
need to be adjusted or optimized based on network status change.

## Network Security Drills

The AI Agent can help construct a dynamic attack-defense verification system
in network security drills through NDT and AI reasoning capabilities. It uses
generative AI to automatically generate diversified attack paths, models
network topologies with graph neural networks, covers attack stages such as
reconnaissance and penetration, and dynamically adjusts strategies via reinforcement
learning to simulate the adaptive characteristics of network attacks. The
virtual range built based on the NDT can 1:1 map the production environment,
supporting simulations of composite scenarios like ransomware chain attacks
and supply chain attacks—such as simulating the entire process of Conti
virus laterally penetrating to domain controllers through weak passwords.

During drills, the AI Agent automatically deploys virtual environments with
vulnerabilities, collects defense response data in real time through NDT,
and generates attack path heatmaps and repair suggestions. This capability
can further verify emergency response processes, inject real-time threat
intelligence to dynamically update drill scenarios, and simulate end-to-end
automated deployment, vulnerability injection, and real-time analysis of
security drills, enhancing the proactive verification ability of defense
systems against real-world threats.

# Challenges of Integrating Service-oriented AI into Network Management

In addition to the research challenges in coupling AI and network management
specified in {{?I-D.irtf-nmrg-ai-challenges}}, this document
also identifies some challenges that need to be considered when integrating
service-oriented AI into network management.

## Hallucination

Hallucination refers to the generation of AI responses that are incorrect, irrelevant,
or even nonsensical in relation to the input or context provided.
Although Gen-AI can produce seemingly impressive results at first glance, there's
a risk of them being completely wrong at times. These hallucinations can lead to
incorrect decisions and actions in network management. For example, if the AI
generates inaccurate network configurations or diagnoses faults incorrectly, it
may cause network disruptions or security vulnerabilities. The challenge lies
in identifying and correcting these hallucinations to ensure the reliability of
AI-driven network management actions.

## Security

Integrating AI into network management introduces new security challenges. Large
volumes of network data needs to be accessed to learn network behaviors and make
accurate decisions. Protecting sensitive network data and ensuring the integrity
of AI-generated decisions are crucial. Besides, AI systems can become targets for attacks
aimed at compromising network security. For instance, malicious actors could attempt
to manipulate AI models to make them generate harmful network configurations or
to disclose confidential network information. Additionally, the integration of AI
Agents from different vendors may create new vulnerabilities that need to be
addressed, e.g., lack of effective authentication and authorization among different Agents.
In summary, ensuring robust security measures throughout the entire AI-based network
management architecture is essential to prevent unauthorized access and maintain the
security of the network infrastructure.

## Data Quality and Consistency

The performance of AI models heavily relies on the quality and consistency of the
data they're trained on. In network management area, data sources can be diverse
and heterogeneous, leading to potential issues such as data inconsistencies,
missing, or outdated data. Poor-quality data may result in inaccurate
AI predictions and decisions. For example, if incorrect or outdated network configuration data is
provided, the model may provide incorrect repair advice when diagnosing network incidents
or faults, it may suggest checking an non-existing interface. Ensuring that data is
properly cleaned, validated, and maintained is a significant challenge in providing
reliable inputs for AI-driven network management.

## Interpretability and Explainability

AI-generated decisions can sometimes be difficult to interpret and explain,
as the AI model structure and the parameter settings make it hard to track
its internal decision-making logic. Network operators need to understand the
reasoning behind AI-driven decisions to trust and effectively
utilize them. For example, if an AI system recommends a particular configuration
change to optimize the network performance, operators may wonder why that
specific change is being suggested. The lack of interpretability can hinder
the adoption of AI Driven Network Management and make it challenging to identify
potential issues with AI-generated recommendations.

## Fast Decision-making

In network operation and maintenance scenarios with high real-time requirements,
such as scheduling strategy optimization and critical fault repair, the rapid
generation of network optimization decisions is crucial. However, AI Agents based
on large models adopt a "Token-based" generation and reasoning approach, which is
limited by computing power and algorithms, resulting in generally slow reasoning
speeds. In addition, the simulation and verification process of Network Digital
Twin (NDT) further increases decision latency, which leads to long end-to-end
decision-making time in complex scenarios and is difficult to meet the real-time
requirements of services. To improve decision efficiency, continuous efforts are
needed in lightweight NDT modeling algorithms, optimizing large model reasoning
frameworks (such as quantization technology and parallel computing), and deploying
high-performance AI acceleration hardware.

# Security Considerations

The security consideration from {{?I-D.irtf-nmrg-network-digital-twin-arch}} apply here. In addition, the following architectural risks need to be considered:

- Single point of failure:
  While the architecture provides resiliency through its recovery capabilities, the network digital twin or Network AI Agent could become a single point of failure if not
  implemented with sufficientcredundancy and fault tolerance.

- AI/ML model integrity:
  If the AI/ML models used by the digital twin are compromised or poisoned with bad data, they could begin making incorrect or malicious decisions. Robust checks and
   validation are necessary to ensure the integrity of these models.

- Lifecycle security:
  The entire lifecycle of the network AI agents and the network digital twin—from initial deployment and configuration to updates and decommissioning—must be secured
  against unauthorized access and manipulation.
