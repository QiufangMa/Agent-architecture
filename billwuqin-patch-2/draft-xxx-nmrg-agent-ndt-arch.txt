Network Digital Twin based Architecture for AI driven Network Operations
                  draft-xxx-nmrg-agent-ndt-arch-latest

Abstract

   A Network Digital Twin (NDT) provides a network emulation tool usable
   for different purposes such as scenario planning, impact analysis,
   and change management.  Integrating a Network Digital Twin into
   network management together with AI, it allows the network management
   activities to take user intent or service requirements as input,
   automatically assess, model, and refine optimization strategies under
   realistic conditions but in a risk-free environment.  An environment
   that operates to meet these types of requirements is said to have
   service-oriented AI for Network Operations.

   AI for Network Operations brings together existing technologies such
   as Network Digital Twin and AI which may be seen as the use of a
   toolbox of existing components enhanced with a few new elements.

   This document describes an architecture for service-oriented AI for
   network operations and shows how these components work together.  It
   provides a cookbook of existing technologies to satisfy the
   architecture and realize intent-based networking to meet the needs of
   the network service.

1.  Introduction

   The rapid expansion of network scale and the increasing demands on
   these networks necessitate of continuous network reconfiguration to
   better adapt to ever-changing service requirements.

   Since network changes are directly related to service operations, any
   successful change needs to not only ensure that new services are
   provisioned smoothly, but also that existing services are not
   affected and that no problems are introduced with the new
   configurations.  Network operators are, therefore, increasingly
   cautious about making network changes, given that they need to review
   the solution design as well as evaluate all change impacts, before
   making any change.  Then, after the change, they need to perform
   dialling tests, monitor traffic, and manually check table entries.

   The Network Digital Twin (NDT)
   [I-D.irtf-nmrg-network-digital-twin-arch] has been proposed as a mean
   to provide a network emulation tool for scenario planning, impact
   analysis, and change management.  Integrating a Network Digital Twin
   into network management together with AI, it allows network
   management activities to dynamically adapt to customer needs, network
   changes, as well as to automatically assess, model, and refine
   optimization strategies under realistic conditions but in a risk-free
   environment.  An environment that operates to meet these types of
   requirements is said to have service-oriented AI for network
   operations.

   Service-oriented AI for network operations provide the following
   capabilities to applications by coordinating the components that
   operate and manage the network:

   *  Service intent and service assurance work together to ensure that
      the network change or network optimization aligns with business
      goals and that the services provided meet the agreed-upon Service
      Level Agreements (SLAs).

   *  Provide Network capacity planning and ensure that the network has
      sufficient capacity , resources, and infrastructure to meet
      current and future demands.

   *  Model the network configuration change and use a virtual topology
      model to test network changes and assess the effect of the network
      configuration changes on the network.

   *  Model the protocol operations and interactions among devices in
      the network and simulate specific networking protocols such as IS-
      IS, OSPF, BGP, SR, etc to understand how they perform under
      different conditions.

   *  Model traffic flow across the network, including traffic
      generation, flow control, routing, and congestion control and
      evaluate traffic's impact on network performance.

   This document describes an architecture for service-oriented AI for
   network operations, showing how these components work together.  It
   provides a cookbook of existing technologies to satisfy the
   architecture and realize intent-based networking to meet the needs of
   applications.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The document uses the following definitions and acronyms defined in
   [I-D.irtf-nmrg-network-digital-twin-arch]:

   *  Network Digital Twin (NDT)

   *  Artificial Intelligence (AI)

   The following acronyms are used throughout this document:

   *  Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen-AI)

   *  Large Language Model (LLM)

   *  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

   Besides, this document defines the following terminology:

   AI Agent:  AI Agent is an autonomous system or entity with awareness
      of its environment, capable of conducting analysis, making
      decisions, and executing actions with specific intent based on its
      knowledge representation to achieve a set of service goals.

3.  Introduction of Concepts

3.1.  Generative AI and AI Agent

   The integration of AI into network operations has marked a
   significant leap forward in the pursuit of network automation and
   intelligence, while generative AI further enhances the role of AI for
   network operations and management.  Generative AI is a subfield of AI
   that uses generative models such as Large Language Models (LLMs) to
   generate new and original content such as text, images, videos, or
   other forms of data with the capability to adapt and make decisions
   to achieve specific goals.

   An AI agent refers to a system or program that uses AI to perform
   tasks on behalf of users.  In the context of network operations and
   management, agents are increasingly being designed to perform tasks
   such as understanding user intent, generating network configurations,
   diagnosing and resolving network incidents
   [I-D.ietf-nmop-network-incident-yang].  Meanwhile, other SDOs also
   try to define terms related to AI agent in the context of network
   operations and management, e.g., TM Forum defines Autonomous Agent in
   [TMF-1258] as AN (Autonomous Network) Terminology.

3.2.  Network Digital Twin

   The Network Digital Twin is a digital representation that is used in
   the context of network.  The concept and architecture of the Network
   Digital Twin are specified in
   [I-D.irtf-nmrg-network-digital-twin-arch].  Three core functional
   components which includes Data Repository component, a Service
   Mapping Models component, and an NDT Management component are
   introduced to characterize the Network Digital Twin and its reference
   architecture.

   The Network Digital Twin is widely recognized to be useful as an
   advanced platform for network emulation, serving as a tool for
   scenario planning, impact analysis, and change management.  By
   delivering applications requests to the Network Digital Twin through
   standardized interfaces (see Section 9.4 of
   [I-D.irtf-nmrg-network-digital-twin-arch]), the Network Digital Twin
   exposes the various capabilities to network applications.

4.  Characteristics of AI for Network Operations

   AIOPS was first defined by Gartner in 2016, combining "artificial
   intelligence" and "IT operations" to describe the application of AI
   and machine learning to enhance IT operations.  However there is no
   unified definition for characteristic of "AI for network operations"
   within the networking industry.  Referring to the characteristics of
   AIOPS in IT field and the characteristics of networking itself, this
   document introduces six key elements (i.e., awareness, decision,
   analysis, execution, intent and knowledge) to characterize the AI for
   network operation and its use, as shown in Figure 1.  They together
   form a close-loop of network operation and management.

    Figure 1: Six Key Elements to Characterize AI for network operation

   *  Intent:  Intent is defined as a set of operational goals and
         outcomes defined in a declarative manner without specifying how
         to achieve or implement them in [RFC9315].  The AI Agent must
         accurately interpret and understand the user's high-level
         business or operational objectives, this involves translating
         declarative requirements into specific network instructions,
         e.g., configurations.

   *  Decision:  Based on the intent and network analysis, AI makes
         informed decisions.  These decisions could involve dynamically
         adjusting network parameters, e.g., rerouting traffic to avoid
         congestion.  The decision-making process is driven by
         predefined policies, real-time data analysis, and AI models
         (e.g., LLMs) that enable the AI agent to choose the best course
         of action to meet the specified intent.  AI agent may also
         verify the correctness of the decision outcome by performing
         some network simulation or validation process.

   *  Analysis:  The AI agent continuously analyzes vast amounts of
         network data from various sources, including network telemetry
         [RFC9232] and external feeds, and identify the gap between user
         intent and the existing network status.  Leveraging machine
         learning and other data analytics techniques, it also
         identifies network fault, problem, incident, anomaly, and so
         on.  Their distinction is further discussed in
         [I-D.ietf-nmop-terminology].

   *  Awareness:  Awareness is achieved through real-time monitoring and
         data collection.  The AI agent maintains a comprehensive
         visibility of the network, enabling it to make context-aware
         decisions.  Network operators can also use the awareness
         understand the exact cause of specific network issues and
         achieve closed-loop decision-making.

   *  Execution:  Once a decision is made, the AI agent executes the
         necessary actions to implement it.  This could involve, e.g.,
         sending configuration to network devices through NETCONF/
         RESTCONF protocols.  The execution is carried out in a
         controlled and precise manner to ensure that the network
         behaves as intended without causing disruptions.  The AI agent
         also verifies that the executed actions have the desired effect
         and makes the proper adjustments if needed.

   *  Knowledge:  The AI agent relies on a knowledge base that includes
         network policies, historical data, expert experience, and best
         practices in product manual.  The knowledge is used to inform
         its analysis, decision-making, and execution processes.  Over
         time, the AI agent can expand its knowledge through machine
         learning, incorporating new data and experiences to improve its
         performance.  For example, it learns which configurations are
         optimal for specific scenarios or how to respond most
         effectively to particular types of network incidents
         [I-D.ietf-nmop-network-incident-yang].

     Figure 2: An Architecture for Integrating Generative AI with
                         Network Digital Twin

5.2.  Functional Components

5.2.1.  Multi-domain Orchestrator

   Multi-domain orchestrator serves as the top-level coordinator and
   manages the interactions across different autonomous domains.  Multi-
   domain orchestrator may invoke Network Digital Twin to perform
   functions such as analyze, diagnose, optimize, control, and emulate
   as per [I-D.irtf-nmrg-network-digital-twin-arch].  It also provide
   means to convey user intent to each autonomous domain through a user-
   facing Graphical User Interface (GUI) or machine-to-machine North
   Bound Interface (NBI).

5.2.2.  Autonomous Domain

   An autonomous domain is a self-governing unit that achieves NDT and
   AI driven network autonomous management.

5.2.2.1.  Network Digital Twin

   A Network Digital Twin provides an enhanced and optimized solution in
   the face of increasing network and business types, scale, and
   complexity.  It simulates the behavior, performance, and
   characteristics of the actual network, which could help in validation
   and testing scenarios, analyzing and predicting network behavior
   without affecting the real physical network.

   As described in Section 7 of
   [I-D.irtf-nmrg-network-digital-twin-arch], the core functional
   components of an Network Digital Twin includes Data Repository,
   Service Mapping Models, and a Network Digital Twin Management
   component.  The Network Digital Twin collects the real-time
   operational and instrumentation data from network through the
   appropriate real network-facing input interfaces, and it delivers NDT
   services through appropriate application-facing output interfaces,
   which is the interfaces to AI Agent(s) in Figure 2.

5.2.2.2.  AI Agent(s)

   AI Agent(s) act(s) as the smart brain of the Autonomous Domain, which
   is responsible for conducting AI-based analysis and making decisions
   regarding network operations.  It leverages the inference of LLM, the
   simulation of Network Digital Twin, and the contextual and domain-
   specific knowledge provided by Knowledge Base to accomplish specific
   network operation task.

   Agents could be scenario-oriented and classified according to the
   function they perform.  It is also possible for multiple Agents to
   collaborate in some scenarios.  Multi-Agents management is needed to
   handle the agent instance lifecycle (e.g., deployment, update, and
   retirement of AI Agent), Agent registration, Agent discovery, and so
   on.  Some ongoing efforts (MCP [MCP], A2A [A2A]) in the industry may
   help with multi-agents coordination.

5.2.2.3.  Knowledge Base

   The Knowledge Base serves as a crucial repository of information
   within the architecture.  It enables the injection of expert
   knowledge and provides the necessary knowledge and memory that helps
   AI Agent(s) make more accurate and context-aware decisions.  It also
   helps mitigate the hallucination problems that can arise in large-
   scale models, which enhances the accuracy of task execution.
   Additionally, the Knowledge Base plays a key role in providing the
   data needed for techniques like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG),
   which further boosts the system's ability to generate reliable and
   relevant outputs.

5.2.2.4.  Data Collection

   Data Collection component is responsible for gathering data from the
   physical network through various different tools and methods (e.g.,
   IPFIX [RFC7011], YANG-push [RFC8639],[RFC8641], BMP [RFC7854]).  It
   collects various types of network data including configuration data,
   operational data, network topology, routing data, logs, and trace on
   management plane, control plane, and forwarding plane as needed.  The
   collected data is fed into the Network Digital Twin and AI Agent(s)
   to provide with up-to-date information about the current state of the
   physical network.

5.2.2.5.  Execution

   Once network decisions are made and confirmed, the Execution
   component performs specific actions to the physical network, e.g.,
   modify specific configuration on network devices through protocols
   like NETCONF [RFC6241] and RESTCONF [RFC8040].  It is the component
   that makes the planned control and management changes a reality in
   the real physical network.

5.2.3.  Physical Network

   This is the actual hardware and infrastructure that makes up the
   network, which includes a set of network devices and wiring.  In a
   physical network, Network Elements (NEs) with Lightweight AI
   [I-D.irtf-nmrg-ai-challenges] may also achieve some local close loop
   without relying on external AI or human intervention.  It is also
   possible for the Leightweight AI to coordinate with AI Agent(s) to
   enhance the automation and efficiency of network operations.  The
   Leightweight AI models could be trained, validated, deployed, and
   executed on Network Elements, and further refined (e.g., model re-
   training) through monitoring and continuous optimization based on
   feedback from LLM.

5.3.  Architecture Requirements

   There are a couple of key requirements of the architecture to
   integrate Network Digital Twin with service-oriented AI which are
   crucial in ensuring the proposed architecture can handle the complex
   and dynamic network scenarios for network operations and management.

5.3.1.  Human-in-the-loop

   This allows human experts to provide guidance and make critical
   decisions when necessary.  By involving human in the process, the
   architecture can leverage their insights and experience, ensuring AI
   actions align with organizational goals.

   Human-in-the-loop is also helpful to provide a safeguard for complex
   or sensitive decisions, where human judgement is essential to avoid
   potential errors or ethical dilemmas.

5.3.2.  Interoperability via Open Standards

   Standardized protocols and interfaces facilitate smooth communication
   and ensures different systems and devices from various vendors can
   work together seamlessly.  The interfaces between AI Agent(s) and
   Network Digital Twin are the application-facing interfaces as defined
   in [I-D.irtf-nmrg-network-digital-twin-arch].  There are some ongoing
   efforts that are working on the standardization of AI Agent
   communication [I-D.rosenberg-ai-protocols].

5.3.3.  Feedback-driven Improvement

   The architecture should incorporate mechanism for continuous
   improvement based on feedback.  This includes collecting data on AI
   decisions, network performance, and user feedback to identify areas
   for enhancement.  By analyzing the feedback, the system can adapt and
   optimize its operations over time, leading to better performance and
   more accurate decision-making.  For example, if an AI Agent fails to
   accurately identify the exact cause of a network incident, the
   relevant records can be submitted as negative samples to the LLM
   which provides inference services, this allows the LLM to be trained
   on these negative samples for optimization.  Feedback-driven
   improvement also enables the architecture to evolve with changing
   network conditions and requirements.

5.3.4.  Scalability and Flexibility

   The architecture must be designed to scale efficiently to accommodate
   growing network demands and increasing data volumes.  It should also
   be flexible enough to adapt to new network scenarios and operational
   requirements.  This means that components should be modular, allowing
   for easy addition or modification of functionality without disrupting
   the entire system.  Scalability and flexibility ensure that the
   architecture remains effective and relevant in the face of evolving
   network challenges.

6.  AI for Network Operation: A collection of Use Cases

   AI Agent could help in the following phases which are usually
   mentioned in network management:

   *  Network Planning and Design: includes the understanding of user
      intent, generation of solutions, and simulation for decision-
      making.

   *  Service Deployment: includes the construction of the physical
      network, as well as intent understanding, pre-deployment
      simulation, automated configuration, post-deployment validation,
      and other capabilities to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of
      network configuration for service deployment.

   *  Network Monitoring and Troubleshooting: includes intent
      monitoring, issues identification, solution generation, evaluation
      and decision-making, solution implementation, and service
      validation.

   *  Network Change and Optimization: involves the design, evaluation,
      decision-making, implementation, and validation of network
      configuration changes or optimizations to improve network
      operation efficiency.

   In all phases and use cases, after the Agent performs specific
   action, it always continuously monitors the network by data
   collection.  Based on the result of network running analysis and user
   explicit feedback, it may adjust and optimize the management strategy
   if necessary.

6.1.  Network Configuration Change

   Network configuration changes are needed in scenarios such as
   optimizing network or service performance, provisioning new network
   services, or resolving network incidents/faults.  Network
   configuration change leveraging AI and Network Digital Twin may
   experience the following typical steps:

   Step 1:  The network operator inputs the intent of network
      configuration change into the AI Agent using natural language.
      The network operator may simply explain the objectives and
      requirements of the changes.

   Step 2:  AI Agent first verifies the identity of the user requesting
      the change and checks the user's permissions to make certain types
      of network changes against predefined rules or policies.  It then
      understands and parses the initial intent of the request, and
      leverages the powerful knowledge and reasoning capabilities of LLM
      to generate initial suggestions for specific network configuration
      update, which may include multiple possible network configuration
      change plans if possible.

   Step 3:  AI Agent communicates with the Network Digital Twin to
      validate the suggested configuration change, including the syntax
      and semantics of the configuration, verification of effected
      application and resources.  The network digital Twin may generate
      a report indicating the validation result, and suggested
      configuration fix when the validation fails after network
      simulation leveraging the current physical network operational
      state.

   Step 4:  AI Agent may generate a configuration change plan and submit
      to the network operator for approval.  Based on the feedback from
      the operator, AI Agent then further decides whether to optimize
      the change plan or deliver the plan to the Execution component to
      conduct the physical network configuration change.

6.2.  Network Troubleshooting

   AI Agent could assist in network troubleshooting in the following
   significant aspects:

   *  Fault Identification:  AI Agent continuously monitors and
         aggregates data from various sources, the comprehensive data
         collection provides a holistic view of the network operational
         state.  By analyzing the real-time data, AI Agent could detect
         network anomalies swiftly, which enables the prompt
         identification of potential issues before they escalate into
         major faults, minimizing downtime or service disruptions.  In
         some cases, the Leightweight AI located in the Network Element
         may handle some simple fault identification tasks (e.g.,
         optical module fault automatic identification) to enhance the
         awareness, while the AI Agent and LLM could leverage their
         powerful processing capabilities to analyze the time-domain
         data collected from the optical module.

   *  Fault Diagnosis:  Once a fault is identified, AI Agent delves into
         diagnosing the exact cause, it may also invoke some existing
         operations such as "incident-diagnose" RPC defined in
         [I-D.ietf-nmop-network-incident-yang].  By correlating symptoms
         and/or applying AI models trained on historical data, it can
         narrow down the potential causes and pinpoint the exact cause,
         which accelerates the diagnosis process and reduces the time
         needed to address the issue.

   *  Fault Repair:  After diagnosing the fault, AI Agent can generate
         targeted repair solutions.  These solutions range from specific
         configuration adjustments to more complex fixes (e.g., hardware
         replacement).  AI Agent would also communicate with the Network
         Digital Twin to simulate the proposed repair solutions and get
         feedback from the Network Digital Twin.  In advanced setups, AI
         Agent may automatically execute these repairs, ensuring quick
         restoration of normal operations and enhancing the overall
         reliability and efficiency of network management.  But it may
         also first present the fault details and repair advice to the
         network operator for review, and proceed to carry out the
         repair task once it is confirmed.

6.3.  Network Optimization

   Network optimization is often introduced due to the AI Agent's
   awareness of some potential network faults or anomalies through
   continuously monitoring of network operational state, e.g., AI models
   may predicts network congestion by analyzing historical and real-time
   network traffic data.  It may also be triggered by the network
   operator actively inputting the network optimization intent.

   Based on the analysis of network data and user's intent (if any), AI
   Agent proposes network optimization strategies.  For instance, once
   the network congestion sometime in the future is predicted, it may
   proactively optimize the network configuration, or suggest scaling up
   to meet specific demands.

   Before the network optimization is conducted, AI Agent implements and
   evaluates the optimization solution using the Network Digital Twin.
   This may need repeated trials and validations based on specific
   evaluation criteria, before the optimal strategy could be selected.
   AI Agent may also first present the suggested network optimization
   solution to the network operator for review, and apply it to the
   physical network after obtaining approval from the network operator.

6.4.  Network level Energy Efficiency Management

   Network level Energy Efficiency refer to a set of processes used to
   discover a inventory of capabilities, use specific metrics to monitor
   and assess energy consumption of the network , operate, and control
   the use of available energy in an optimized manner while achieving
   the network’s functional and performance requirements by improving
   overall network utilization.

   Network level Energy Efficiency allows network operators not only see
   real time energy consumption in the network devices of large scale
   network through interaction with the GREEN Network AI Agent, but also
   allow them see

   o which network devices enable energy saving, which devices not,which
   are legacy ones,

   o The total energy consumption changing trend over the time of the
   day, for all network devices,

   o Energy efficiency changing trend over the time of the day for the
   whole network.

   On the other hand, With the better observability to energy
   consumption statistics data and energy efficiency statistics data,
   the AI Agent can know which part of the network need to be adjusted
   or optimized based on network status change.

6.5.  Collaboration between small AI model and large AI model

   In the past, we only support AI and machine learning technologies at
   the network level, e.g., we can use collected various different
   network data to provide network analysis and generate network
   insight.

   With more intelligence introduced into the network element, more GPU/
   NPU resource can be allocated for AI inference, this make
   collaboration between large AI model And small AI model become
   possible.  On one hand, we can use accumulated field engineering
   expertise to train large AI model into one foundation model for fault
   management AI agent, On the other hand, we can deploy small AI model,
   leverage hardware resource or chipset resource in the intelligent
   network element to collect more fine granularity data or provide
   local processing for Collected data and summary report generation,
   Trend prediction, etc.  With collaboration between large AI model and
   small AI model, we can allow AI Agent within the Network controller
   interact with network element and has more quick response to network
   change.

7.  Challenges of Integrating Service-oriented AI into Network
    Management

   In addition to the research challenges in coupling AI and network
   management specified in [I-D.irtf-nmrg-ai-challenges], this document
   also identifies some challenges that need to be considered when
   integrating service-oriented AI into network management.

7.1.  Hallucination

   Hallucination refers to the generation of AI responses that are
   incorrect, irrelevant, or even nonsensical in relation to the input
   or context provided.  Although Gen-AI can produce seemingly
   impressive results at first glance, there's a risk of them being
   completely wrong at times.  These hallucinations can lead to
   incorrect decisions and actions in network management.  For example,
   if the AI generates inaccurate network configurations or diagnoses
   faults incorrectly, it may cause network disruptions or security
   vulnerabilities.  The challenge lies in identifying and correcting
   these hallucinations to ensure the reliability of AI-driven network
   management actions.

7.2.  Security

   Integrating AI into network management introduces new security
   challenges.  Large volumes of network data needs to be accessed to
   learn network behaviors and make accurate decisions.  Protecting
   sensitive network data and ensuring the integrity of AI-generated
   decisions are crucial.  Besides, AI systems can become targets for
   attacks aimed at compromising network security.  For instance,
   malicious actors could attempt to manipulate AI models to make them
   generate harmful network configurations or to disclose confidential
   network information.  Additionally, the integration of AI Agents from
   different vendors may create new vulnerabilities that need to be
   addressed, e.g., lack of effective authentication and authorization
   among different Agents.  In summary, ensuring robust security
   measures throughout the entire AI-based network management
   architecture is essential to prevent unauthorized access and maintain
   the security of the network infrastructure.

7.3.  Data Quality and Consistency

   The performance of AI models heavily relies on the quality and
   consistency of the data they're trained on.  In network management
   area, data sources can be diverse and heterogeneous, leading to
   potential issues such as data inconsistencies, missing, or outdated
   data.  Poor-quality data may result in inaccurate AI predictions and
   decisions.  For example, if incorrect or outdated network
   configuration data is provided, the model may provide incorrect
   repair advice when diagnosing network incidents or faults, it may
   suggest checking an non-existing interface.  Ensuring that data is
   properly cleaned, validated, and maintained is a significant
   challenge in providing reliable inputs for AI-driven network
   management.

7.4.  Interpretability and Explainability

   AI-generated decisions can sometimes be difficult to interpret and
   explain, as the AI model structure and the parameter settings make it
   hard to track its internal decision-making logic.  Network operators
   need to understand the reasoning behind AI-driven decisions to trust
   and effectively utilize them.  For example, if an AI system
   recommends a particular configuration change to optimize the network
   performance, operators may wonder why that specific change is being
   suggested.  The lack of interpretability can hinder the adoption of
   AI for network management and make it challenging to identify
   potential issues with AI-generated recommendations.
