Abstract

   A Network Digital Twin (NDT) provides a network emulation tool for
   scenario planning, impact analysis, and change management.
   Integrating a Network Digital Twin into network management together
   with AI, intent allows the network management take user intent data
   or service requirements as input, automatically assess, model, and
   refine optimization strategies under real conditions but in a risk-
   free environment.  An environment that operates to meet these types
   of requirements is said to have service oriented AI for Network
   Operations.

   AI for Network Operation brings together existing technologies such
   as network digital twin, AI and may be seen as the use of a toolbox
   of existing components enhanced with a few new elements.

   This document describes an architecture and framework for service
   oriented AI for Network Operation, showing how these components work
   together.  It provides a cookbook of existing technologies to satisfy
   the architecture and realize intent based networking to meet the
   needs of the applications.

1.  Introduction

   The rapid expansion of network scale and the increasing demands on
   these networks necessitate making network change better adapt to
   ever-changing service requirements.

   Since network changes are directly related to service operations, any
   successful change needs to not only ensure that new services are
   provisioned smoothly, but also that existing services are not
   affected and that no problems are introduced.  Network operators or
   O&M personnel are, therefore, increasingly cautious about making
   network changes, given that they need to review the solution design
   as well as evaluate all change impacts, before making any change.
   Then, after the change, they need to perform dialing tests, monitor
   traffic, and manually check table entries.

   A Network Digital Twin (NDT)
   [I-D.irtf-nmrg-network-digital-twin-arch] was developed to provide a
   network emulation tool for scenario planning, impact analysis, and
   change management.  Integrating a Network Digital Twin into network
   management together with AI, intent allows network management
   dynamically adapt to customer needs, automatically assess, model, and
   refine optimization strategies under real conditions but in a risk-
   free environment.  An environment that operates to meet these types
   of requirements is said to have service oriented AI for Network
   Operations.

   Service oriented AI for Network Operations provide the following
   types of service to applications by coordinating the components that
   operate and manage the network:

   *  Service intent and service assurance work together to ensure that
      the network change or network optimization aligns with business
      goals and that the services provided meet the agreed-upon Service
      Level Agreements (SLAs).

   *  Provide Network Capacity planning and ensure that the network has
      sufficient capacity , resources, and infrastructure to meet
      current and future demands.

   *  Model the protocol operations and interactions among devices in
      the network and Simulate specific networking protocols such as IS-
      IS, OSPF, BGP, SR to understand how they perform under different
      conditions.

   *  Model traffic flow across the network, including traffic
      generation, flow control, routing, and congestion control and
      evaluate traffic's impact on network performance.

   This document describes an architecture and framework for service
   oriented AI for Network Operation, showing how these components work
   together.  It provides a cookbook of existing technologies to satisfy
   the architecture and realize intent based networking to meet the
   needs of the applications.

3.  Introduction of Concepts

3.1.  Generative AI and AI Agent

   The integration of AI into network operations has marked a
   significant leap forward in the pursuit of network automation and
   intelligence, while generative AI further enhances the role of AI in
   network operations and management.  Generative AI is a subfield of AI
   that uses generative models such as LLMs to generate new and original
   content such as text, images, videos, or other forms of data with the
   capability to adapt and make decisions to achieve specific goals.
   [TMF-1218] lists full-stack AI as one of key requirements of
   Autonomous Network capabilities, and [TMF-1345] highlights the
   potential of generative AI in driving the evoluation of autonomous
   networks.  Other SDOs like ETSI (Experiential Networked Intelligence)
   ENI is actively advancing the integration of AI in networks and
   services [ETSI-ENI035].

   AI agent which takes the power of generative AI a step further refers
   to a system or program that uses AI to perform tasks on behalf of
   users.  AI Agent is an autonomous entity that can perceive the
   environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific
   goals.  In the context of network operations and management, agents
   are increasingly being designed to perform tasks such as
   understanding user intent, generating network configurations,
   diagnosing and resolving network incidents
   [I-D.ietf-nmop-network-incident-yang].

3.2.  Network Digital Twin

   The Network Digital Twin is a digital representation that is used in
   the context of network.  The concept and archiecture of the Network
   Digital Twin are specified in
   [I-D.irtf-nmrg-network-digital-twin-arch].  Three core functional
   components which includes Data Repository component, a Service
   Mapping Models component, and an NDT Management component are
   introduced to characterize the Network Digital Twin and its reference
   architecture.

   The Network Digital Twin is widely recognized to be useful as an
   advanced platform for network emulation, serving as a tool for
   scenario planning, impact analysis, and change management.  By
   delivering applications requests to the Network Digital Twin through
   standardized interfaces (see Section 9.4 of
   [I-D.irtf-nmrg-network-digital-twin-arch]), the Network Digital Twin
   exposes the various capabilities to network applications.

4.  AI for Network Operation

4.1.  Characteristics of AI for Network Operations

   AIOPs was first defined by Gartner in 2016, combining "artificial
   intelligence" and "IT operations" to describe the application of AI
   and machine learning to enhance IT operations.  However there is no
   unified definition for characteristic of "AI for Network operation"
   within the networking industry.  Referring to the characteristics of
   AIOPS in IT field and the characteristics of networking itself, this
   document introduces six key elements (i.e., awareness, decision,
   analysis, execution, intent and knowledge) to characterize the AI for
   network operation and its use, as shown in Figure 1.  They together
   form a close-loop of network operation and management.

    Figure 1: Six Key Elements to Characterize AI for network operation

   *  Intent:  Intent is defined as a set of operational goals and
         outcomes defined in a declarative manner without specifying how
         to achieve or implement them in [RFC9315].  The AI agent must
         accurately intepret and understand the user's high-level
         business or operational objectives, this involves translating
         declarative requirements into specific network instructions,
         e.g., configurations.

   *  Decision:  Based on the intent and network analysis, the AI agent
         makes informed decisions.  These decisions could involve
         dynamically adjusting network parameters, e.g., rerouting
         traffic to avoid congestion.  The decision-making process is
         driven by predefined policies, real-time data analysis, and AI
         models (e.g., LLMs) that enable the AI agent to choose the best
         course of action to meet the specified intent.  AI agent may
         also verify the correctness the decision by performing some
         network simulation or validation process.

   *  Analysis:  The AI agent continuously analyzes vast amounts of
         network data from various source, including network telemetry
         [RFC9232] and external feeds, and identify the gap between user
         intent and the existing network status.  Leveraging machine
         learning and other data analytics techniques, it also
         identifies network fault, problem, incident, anomaly, and so
         on.  Their distinction is further discussed in
         [I-D.ietf-nmop-terminology].

   *  Awareness:  Awareness is achieved through real-time monitoring and
         data collection.  The AI agent maintains a comprehensive
         visibility of the network, enabling it to make context-aware
         decisions.  Network operators can also use the awareness
         understand the root cause of specific network issues and
         achieve closed-loop decision-making.

   *  Execution:  Once a decision is made, the AI agent executes the
         necessary actions to implement it.  This could involve, e.g.,
         sending configuration to network devices through NETCONF/
         RESTCONF protocols.  The execution is carried out in a
         controlled and precise manner to ensure that the network
         behaves as intended without causing disruptions.  The AI agent
         also verifies that the executed actions have the desired effect
         and makes adjustments if needed.

   *  Knowledge:  The AI agent relies on a knowledge base that includes
         network policies, historical data, expert experience, and best
         practices in product manual.  The knowledge is used to inform
         its analysis, decision-making, and execution processes.  Over
         time, the AI agent can expand its knowledge through machine
         learning, incorporating new data and experiences to improve its
         performance.  For example, it learns which configurations are
         optimal for specific scenarios or how to respond most
         effectively to particular types of network incidents
         [I-D.ietf-nmop-network-incident-yang].

6.  AI in Network Operation: A collection of Use Cases

   AI Agent could help in the following three phases which are usually
   mentioned in network management:

   *  Day 0: Network Planning and Design: includes the understanding of
      user intent, generation of solutions, and simulation for decision-
      making.

   *  Day 1: Service Deployment: includes the construction of the
      physical network, as well as intent understanding, pre-deployment
      simulation, automated configuration, post-deployment validation,
      and other capabilities to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of
      network configuration for service deployment.

   *  Day 2: Network Monitoring and Troubleshooting: includes intent
      monitoring, issues identification, solution generation, evaluation
      and decison-making, solution implementation, and service
      validation.

   *  Day N: Network Change and Optimization: involves the design,
      evaluation, decision-making, implementation, and validation of
      network configuration changes or optimizations to improve network
      operation efficiency.
