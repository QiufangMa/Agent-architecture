Abstract

   A Network Digital Twin (NDT) provides a network emulation tool for
   scenario planning, impact analysis, and change management.
   Integrating a Network Digital Twin into network management together
   with AI, intent allows the network management take user intent data
   or service requirements as input, automatically assess, model, and
   refine optimization strategies under real conditions but in a risk-
   free environment.  An environment that operates to meet these types
   of requirements is said to have service oriented AI for Network
   Operations.

   AI for Network Operation brings together existing technologies such
   as network digital twin, AI and may be seen as the use of a toolbox
   of existing components enhanced with a few new elements.

   This document describes an architecture and framework for service
   oriented AI for Network Operation, showing how these components work
   together.  It provides a cookbook of existing technologies to satisfy
   the architecture and realize intent based networking to meet the
   needs of the applications.

1.  Introduction

   The rapid expansion of network scale and the increasing demands on
   these networks necessitate making network change better adapt to
   ever-changing service requirements.

   Since network changes are directly related to service operations, any
   successful change needs to not only ensure that new services are
   provisioned smoothly, but also that existing services are not
   affected and that no problems are introduced.  Network operators or
   O&M personnel are, therefore, increasingly cautious about making
   network changes, given that they need to review the solution design
   as well as evaluate all change impacts, before making any change.
   Then, after the change, they need to perform dialing tests, monitor
   traffic, and manually check table entries.

   A Network Digital Twin (NDT)
   [I-D.irtf-nmrg-network-digital-twin-arch] was developed to provide a
   network emulation tool for scenario planning, impact analysis, and
   change management.  Integrating a Network Digital Twin into network
   management together with AI, intent allows network management
   dynamically adapt to customer needs, automatically assess, model, and
   refine optimization strategies under real conditions but in a risk-
   free environment.  An environment that operates to meet these types
   of requirements is said to have service oriented AI for Network
   Operations.

   Service oriented AI for Network Operations provide the following
   types of service to applications by coordinating the components that
   operate and manage the network:

   *  Service intent and service assurance work together to ensure that
      the network change or network optimization aligns with business
      goals and that the services provided meet the agreed-upon Service
      Level Agreements (SLAs).

   *  Provide Network Capacity planning and ensure that the network has
      sufficient capacity , resources, and infrastructure to meet
      current and future demands.

   *  Model the protocol operations and interactions among devices in
      the network and Simulate specific networking protocols such as IS-
      IS, OSPF, BGP, SR to understand how they perform under different
      conditions.

   *  Model traffic flow across the network, including traffic
      generation, flow control, routing, and congestion control and
      evaluate traffic's impact on network performance.

   This document describes an architecture and framework for service
   oriented AI for Network Operation, showing how these components work
   together.  It provides a cookbook of existing technologies to satisfy
   the architecture and realize intent based networking to meet the
   needs of the applications.

4.1.  Characteristics of AI for Network Operations

   AIOPs was first defined by Gartner in 2016, combining "artificial
   intelligence" and "IT operations" to describe the application of AI
   and machine learning to enhance IT operations.  However there is no
   unified definition for characteristic of "AI for Network operation"
   within the networking industry.  Referring to the characteristics of
   AIOPS in IT field and the characteristics of networking itself, this
   document introduces six key elements (i.e., awareness, decision,
   analysis, execution, intent and knowledge) to characterize the AI for
   network operation and its use, as shown in Figure 1.

6.  AI in Network Operation: A collection of Use Cases

   AI Agent could help in the following three phases which are usually
   mentioned in network management:

   *  Day 0: Network Planning and Design: includes the understanding of
      user intent, generation of solutions, and simulation for decision-
      making.

   *  Day 1: Service Deployment: includes the construction of the
      physical network, as well as intent understanding, pre-deployment
      simulation, automated configuration, post-deployment validation,
      and other capabilities to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of
      network configuration for service deployment.

   *  Day 2: Network Monitoring and Troubleshooting: includes intent
      monitoring, issues identification, solution generation, evaluation
      and decison-making, solution implementation, and service
      validation.

   *  Day N: Network Change and Optimization: involves the design,
      evaluation, decision-making, implementation, and validation of
      network configuration changes or optimizations to improve network
      operation efficiency.
