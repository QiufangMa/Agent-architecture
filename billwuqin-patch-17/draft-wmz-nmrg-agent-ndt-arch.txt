Network Digital Twin based Architecture for AI driven Network Operations
                  draft-wmz-nmrg-agent-ndt-arch-latest

Abstract

   A Network Digital Twin (NDT) provides a network emulation tool usable
   for different purposes such as scenario planning, impact analysis,
   and change management.  Integrating a Network Digital Twin into
   network management together with Agentic AI, it allows the network
   management activities to take user intent or service requirements as
   input, automatically assess, model, and refine optimization
   strategies under realistic conditions but in a risk-free environment.
   Such environment that operates to meet these types of requirements is
   said to have AI driven Network Operations.

   AI driven Network Operations brings together existing technologies
   such as Agentic AI and Network Digital Twin which may be seen as the
   use of a toolbox of existing components enhanced with a few new
   elements.

   This document describes an architecture for AI driven network
   operations and shows how these components work together.  It provides
   a cookbook of existing technologies to satisfy the architecture and
   realize intent-based networking to meet the needs of the network
   service.

1.  Introduction

   The rapid expansion of network scale and the increasing demands on
   these networks necessitate of continuous network reconfiguration to
   better adapt to ever-changing service requirements.

   Since network changes are directly related to service operations, any
   successful change needs to not only ensure that new services are
   provisioned smoothly, but also that existing services are not
   affected and that no problems are introduced with the new
   configurations.  Network operators are, therefore, increasingly
   cautious about making network changes, given that they need to review
   the solution design as well as evaluate all change impacts, before
   making any change.  Then, after the change, they need to perform
   dialling tests, monitor traffic, and manually check table entries.

   The Network Digital Twin (NDT)
   [I-D.irtf-nmrg-network-digital-twin-arch] has been proposed as a mean
   to provide a network emulation tool for scenario planning, impact
   analysis, and change management.  Integrating a Network Digital Twin
   into network management together with Agentic AI, it allows network
   management activities to dynamically adapt to customer needs, network
   changes, as well as to automatically assess, model, and refine
   optimization strategies under realistic conditions but in a risk-free
   environment.  An environment that operates to meet these types of
   requirements is said to have service-oriented AI for network
   operations.

   AI Driven network operations provide the following capabilities to
   applications by coordinating the components that operate and manage
   the network:

   *  Service intent and service assurance work together to ensure that
      the network change or network optimization aligns with business
      goals and that the services provided meet the agreed-upon Service
      Level Agreements (SLAs).

   *  Provide network capacity planning and ensure that the network has
      sufficient capacity , resources, and infrastructure to meet
      current and future demands.

   *  Provide simulation on fault scenarios, formulate recovery plans,
      and verify whether the plans are applicable and effective so that
      the service will not be affected during disaster recovery drill.

   *  Support fault and risk detection and provide network health check
      and network risk check.

   *  Model the network configuration change and use a virtual topology
      model to test network changes and assess the effect of the network
      configuration changes on the network.

   *  Model the protocol operations and interactions among devices in
      the network and simulate specific networking protocols such as IS-
      IS, OSPF, BGP, SR, etc to understand how they perform under
      different conditions.

   *  Model traffic flow across the network, including traffic
      generation, flow control, routing, and congestion control and
      evaluate traffic's impact on network performance.

   *  Support generation of rectification solutions for potential
      network risks and provide verification on the repair solution in
      seconds, including loop, address conflict, and security policy
      conflict.

   This document describes an architecture for AI Driven network
   operations, showing how these components work together.  It provides
   a cookbook of existing technologies to satisfy the architecture and
   realize intent-based networking to meet the needs of applications.

   *  Network Digital Twin (NDT)

   *  Artificial Intelligence (AI)

   The following acronyms are used throughout this document:

   Besides, this document defines the following terminology:

   Network AI Agent:  Network AI Agent is an autonomous system or entity
      with awareness of its environment, capable of conducting analysis,
      making decisions, and executing actions with specific intent based
      on its knowledge representation to achieve a set of service goals
      [TMF-1251D].  In addition, it is able of planning the tasks and
      decomponse the tasks into several sub-tasks and coordinate with
      Task agent for these sub-tasks.

   Task AI Agent:  Task AI Agent is responsible for coordinating with
      Network AI Agent in the multi-Agent System and executing specific
      task assigned by Network AI Agent.

3.  Introduction of Concepts

3.1.  Generative AI and AI Agent

   The integration of AI into network operations has marked a
   significant leap forward in the pursuit of network automation and
   intelligence, while generative AI further enhances the role of AI
   driven network operations and management.  Generative AI is a
   subfield of AI that uses generative models such as Large Language
   Models (LLMs) to generate new and original content such as text,
   images, videos, or other forms of data with the capability to adapt
   and make decisions to achieve specific goals.

   An AI agent refers to a system or program that Large Language Models
   (LLM)s to interact with humans (or other AI Agents) for purposes of
   performing tasks.  In the context of network operations and
   management, Network AI agents are increasingly being designed to
   interact with physical world and act upon it based on tools
   [Google-Agents-Whitepaper] and perform network management tasks such
   as understanding user intent, generating network configurations,
   diagnosing and resolving network incidents
   [I-D.ietf-nmop-network-incident-yang].  Meanwhile, other SDOs also
   try to define terms related to Network AI agent in the context of
   network operations and management, e.g., TM Forum defines Autonomous
   Agent in [TMF-1251D] as one of AN (Autonomous Network) Terminologies.

3.2.  Network Digital Twin

   The Network Digital Twin is a digital representation that is used in
   the context of network.  The concept and architecture of the Network
   Digital Twin are specified in
   [I-D.irtf-nmrg-network-digital-twin-arch].  Three core functional
   components which includes Data Repository component, a Service
   Mapping Models component, and an NDT Management component are
   introduced to characterize the Network Digital Twin and its reference
   architecture.

   The Network Digital Twin is widely recognized to be useful as an
   advanced platform for network emulation, serving as a tool for
   scenario planning, impact analysis, and change management.  By
   delivering applications requests to the Network Digital Twin through
   standardized interfaces (see Section 9.4 of
   [I-D.irtf-nmrg-network-digital-twin-arch]), the Network Digital Twin
   exposes the various capabilities to network applications.

4.  Characteristics of AI driven Network Operations

   AIOPS was first defined by Gartner in 2016, combining "artificial
   intelligence" and "IT operations" to describe the application of AI
   and machine learning to enhance IT operations.  However there is no
   unified definition for characteristic of "AI driven network
   operations" within the networking industry.  Referring to the
   characteristics of AIOPS in IT field and the characteristics of
   networking itself, this document introduces six key elements (i.e.,
   awareness, decision, analysis, execution, intent and knowledge) to
   characterize the AI driven network operation and its use, as shown in
   Figure 1.  They together form a close-loop of network operation and
   management.

        Figure 1: Six Key Elements to Characterize AI driven network
                                 operation

   *  Intent:  Intent is defined as a set of operational goals and
         outcomes defined in a declarative manner without specifying how
         to achieve or implement them in [RFC9315].  The Network AI
         Agent must accurately interpret and understand the user's high-
         level business or operational objectives, this involves
         translating declarative requirements into specific network
         instructions, e.g., configurations.

   *  Knowledge:  The Network AI agent relies on a knowledge base that
         includes network policies, historical data, expert experience,
         extra-system experience (updates to LLMs/their implied
         ‘knowledge bases’) and Manually or semi-manually entered
         knowledge,e.g.,new equipment spec sheets,best practices in
         product manual.  The knowledge is used to inform its analysis,
         decision-making, and execution processes.  Over time, the
         Network AI agent can expand its knowledge through machine
         learning, incorporating new data and experiences to improve its
         performance.  For example, it learns which configurations are
         optimal for specific scenarios or how to respond most
         effectively to particular types of network incidents
         [I-D.ietf-nmop-network-incident-yang].

   *  Analysis:  The Network AI agent continuously analyzes vast amounts
         of network data from various sources, including network
         telemetry [RFC9232] and external feeds, and identify the gap
         between user intent and the existing network status.  By
         integrating Network digital twin
         [I-D.irtf-nmrg-network-digital-twin-arch] with Network AI agent
         and leveraging machine learning and other data analytics
         techniques, it also identifies network fault, problem,
         incident, anomaly and perform data driven intelligent analysis
         such as service impact analysis, and so on.  Their distinction
         is further discussed in [I-D.ietf-nmop-terminology].

   *  Decision:  Based on the intent and network analysis, AI makes
         informed decisions.  By integrating network digital twin
         [I-D.irtf-nmrg-network-digital-twin-arch] and AI, the
         intelligence decisions making can be realized.  These decisions
         could involve dynamically adjusting network parameters, e.g.,
         rerouting traffic to avoid congestion.  The decision-making
         process is driven by predefined policies, real-time data
         analysis, and AI models (e.g., LLMs) that enable the Network AI
         agent to choose the best course of action to meet the specified
         intent.  Network AI agent may also verify the correctness of
         the decision outcome by performing some network simulation or
         validation process.

   *  Awareness:  Awareness is achieved through real-time monitoring and
         data collection.  The Network AI agent maintains a
         comprehensive visibility of the network, enabling it to make
         context-aware decisions.  Network operators can also use the
         awareness understand the exact cause of specific network issues
         and achieve closed-loop decision-making.

   *  Execution:  Once a decision is made, the Network AI agent executes
         the necessary actions to implement it.  This could involve,
         e.g., sending configuration to network controllers or network
         devices through NETCONF/RESTCONF protocols.  The execution is
         carried out in a controlled and precise manner to ensure that
         the network behaves as intended without causing disruptions.
         The Network AI agent also verifies that the executed actions
         have the desired effect and makes the proper adjustments if
         needed.

5.  Architecture Design

5.1.  Overall Architecture

   Figure 2 provides the overall architecture for integrating Network
   Digital Twin and Network AI Agent System.  The components and
   functional interfaces are discussed in Section 5.2 and Section 5.3,
   respectively.  The use cases described in Section 7 show how
   different components are used selectively to provide different
   services.  It is important to understand that the relationships and
   interfaces shown between components in this figure are illustrative
   of some of the common or likely interactions; however, this figure
   does not preclude other interfaces and relationships as necessary to
   realize specific functionality.

5.2.  Functional Components

   This section describes the functional components shown as boxes in
   Figure 2.  The interactions between those components, the functional
   interfaces, are described in Section 5.3.

5.2.1.  Network Applications

   Various network applications at the service level can effectively run
   over a AI driven Network operation platform to to implement either
   conventional or innovative network operations, with low cost and less
   service impact on real networks.

   A network application may be a software tool that a user uses to make
   requests to the network to set up specific services such as end-to-
   end connections or scheduled bandwidth reservations or NOC
   Application /Service AI Agent Application that is responsible for
   monitoring, managing, and maintaining the health, performance, and
   availability of complex networks.

   Network applications make requests that need to be addressed by the
   AI driven network.  Such requests are exchanged through a northbound
   intent interface (e.g., Restful API, Natural Language Programming
   Interface(NLPI),A2A, A2A-T), so that they can be applied by multi-
   agent system at the appropriate twin instance(s).

5.2.2.  Autonomous Domain

   An autonomous domain is a self-governing network that integrates NDT
   and AI driven capabilities to achieve autonomous network management.
   It comprises the following sub-components.

5.2.2.1.  Network Digital Twin

   A Network Digital Twin provides an enhanced and optimized solution in
   the face of increasing network and business types, scale, and
   complexity.  It simulates the behavior, performance, and
   characteristics of the actual network, which could help in validation
   and testing scenarios, analyzing and predicting network behavior
   without affecting the real physical network.

   As described in Section 7 of
   [I-D.irtf-nmrg-network-digital-twin-arch], the core functional
   components of an Network Digital Twin includes Data Repository,
   Service Mapping Models, and a Network Digital Twin Management
   component.  The Network Digital Twin collects the real-time
   operational and instrumentation data from network through the
   appropriate real network-facing input interfaces, and it delivers NDT
   services through appropriate application-facing output interfaces,
   which is the interfaces to Network AI Agent(s) in Figure 2.

5.2.2.2.  Multi-Agent System

   Multi-Agent system acts as the smart brain of the Autonomous Domain,
   which is responsible for conducting AI-based analysis and making
   decisions regarding network management operations.  It usually
   comprises a Network AI Agent and one or multiple task agents.

   The Network AI Agent coordinates cross-task-agent collaboration,
   aligns tasks with user intent, and supervises the task execution of
   each task agent.  And task agents are designed to perform specific
   functionalities, they could be scenario-oriented and classified
   according to the function they perform.  Task Agents can adapt to new
   circumstances through access to evolving knowledge and reasoning,
   planning.  It leverages the inference of LLM, the simulation of
   Network Digital Twin, and the contextual and domain-specific
   knowledge provided by Knowledge Base to accomplish specific network
   operation task.  Some ongoing efforts (MCP [MCP], A2A [A2A]) in the
   industry may help with multi-agents coordination.

5.2.2.3.  Agent Gateway

   The Agent Gateway, which serves as a central management hub, provides
   essential services for the Multi-Agent System, including agent
   registration/discovery, authentication, and knowledge base.

5.2.2.3.1.  Registration

   AI Agents need to first discover each other and understand their
   capabilities to collaborate.  Agent Registration manages the process
   by which new agents could join the system, making them discoverable
   and available.  Each Agent instance submits its own metadata
   information including URI, supported authentication methods, and
   capabilities to the Agent Registry.  And the consumer Agent (e.g.,
   the Network AI Agent) could query or subscribe to the Agent Registry
   to find appropriate Agents for task execution.

   [A2A] implements Agent Registration by providing the Agent Card
   mechanism to ensure Agents from different vendors can register and
   discover other Agents they need.

5.2.2.3.2.  Authentication

   Authentication component enforces trusted inter-Agent communication
   by verifying the identity of AI Agents.  Some existing authentication
   methods such as OAuth 2.0, allow to issue each AI Agent its own
   authentication credentials to establish trusted communication.

   Standardized protocols like TLS (Transport Level Security) could be
   leveraged to protect sensitive data exchanged between AI Agents.

   It is also worth noting that once authenticated, authorization
   defines the specific tools and data an agent can access, which often
   using a Least Privilege access control method.  It is also
   recommended to log every Agent decision and tooling call to maintain
   audit trail.

5.2.2.3.3.  Knowledge Base

   The Knowledge Base serves as a crucial repository of information
   within the architecture.  It enables the injection of expert
   knowledge and and chain of thoughts, provides the necessary knowledge
   and memory that helps Agents make more accurate and practive context-
   aware decisions.  It also helps mitigate the hallucination problems
   that can arise in large-scale models, which enhances the accuracy of
   task execution.  Additionally, the Knowledge Base plays a key role in
   providing the data needed for techniques like Retrieval-Augmented
   Generation (RAG), which further boosts the system's ability to
   generate reliable and relevant outputs.

   In case of coupling MCP [MCP] with the nework management system, the
   new knowledge also can be used to support modification of the
   currently operating automation Closed Loop, such as: - Choice of
   tools (data, analytics, algorithms/decision processes, closed loops)
   - Orchestration of tools

5.2.2.4.  Physical Network

   This is the actual hardware and infrastructure that makes up the
   network, which includes a set of network devices and wiring.  In a
   physical network, Network Elements (NEs) with Lightweight AI
   [I-D.irtf-nmrg-ai-challenges] or AI Agent may also achieve some local
   close loop without relying on human intervention.  It is also
   possible for Lightweight AI or AI Agent to coordinate with other AI
   Agent(s) to enhance the automation and efficiency of network
   operations.  The Network Leightweight AI models could be trained,
   validated, deployed, and executed on Network Elements, and further
   refined (e.g., model re-training) through monitoring and continuous
   optimization based on feedback from LLM.

5.3.  Functional Interfaces

   This section describes the interfaces between functional components
   that might be externalized in an implementation allowing the
   components to be distributed across platforms.  Where existing
   protocols might provide all or most of the necessary capabilities,
   they are noted.

   As noted in Section 5.1, it is important to understand that the
   relationships and interfaces shown between components in Figure 2 are
   illustrative of some of the common or likely interactions; however,
   this figure and the descriptions in the subsections below do not
   preclude other interfaces and relationships as necessary to realize
   specific functionality.  Thus, some of the interfaces described below
   might not be visible as specific relationships in Figure 2, but they
   can nevertheless exist.

5.3.1.  Human in the Loop

   The architecture allows human experts to monitor, guide, approve, or
   intervene in the AI driven network operations.  Human may provide
   guidance and make critical decisions when necessary.  By involving
   human in the process, the architecture can leverage their insights
   and experience, ensuring AI actions align with organizational goals.

   Human in the loop is also helpful to provide a safeguard for complex
   or sensitive decisions, where human judgement is essential to avoid
   potential errors or ethical dilemmas.

   This typically uses natural lanaguage as the primary mode of
   interaction, a chat platform that allows for conversational
   interaction with AI Agents can be leveraged.  In some scenarios,
   operators may use structured format for strategy injection via
   workflows.  Protocols like A2A [A2A], and RESTful API can be
   leveraged.

5.3.2.  Application to Autonomous Domain Interface

   Intent based Network Management helps in delivering application
   requests to the AI Driven network operation platform and exposing the
   various platform capabilities to network applications.

   Standardized protocols and interfaces facilitate smooth communication
   between applications and AI driven network operation platform and
   ensures different systems from various vendors can work together
   seamlessly.  The interfaces between Network applications and Network
   AI Agent can adopt IG1453 Agent to Agent Protocol for Telecoms (A2A-
   T) specified by TM Forum.

5.3.3.  Multi-Agent System to Agent Gateway Interface

   The interface between Multi-Agent System and Agent Gateway serves as
   the management bridge which encompasses a set of services designed to
   manage the lifecycle, security, and collaborative capabilities of the
   AI Agents.

   Registration handles Agent onboarding, lifecycle tracking (e.g.,
   heartbeat monitoring, status updates), and capability-based Agent
   discovery.  Interfaces like RESTful APIs with structural schema for
   AI Agents metadata description could be leveraged.  Protocols like
   A2A [A2A] Agent card mechanism may also be used to ensure
   interoperability among different Agent vendors.  It is also worth
   noting that message queue mechanisms such as Kafka could also be a
   candidate interface for asynchronous communications for agent
   registration and discovery.

   Authentication ensures trusted inter-Agent communication by verifying
   the identity of AI Agents and enforcing security policies throughout
   their interaction.  Protocols like Transport Layer Security (TLS)
   could be leveraged for in-transit data Protection.  While OAuth 2.0
   and OpenID Connect are increasingly used to authenticate AI Agents.

   Knowledge Base service provides contextual data and insights to
   enhance the decision-making accuracy of the Multi-Agent System.
   Interfaces such as Cypher or SPARQL with schema-defind data models
   (e.g., LPG or RDF for knowledge representation) allow efficient
   retrieval and updates.  Other high-throughput interfaces such as gRPC
   or RESTful API can be the candidate for synchronous semantic search
   queries.  For large-scale knowledge operations, asynchronous data
   message systems (e.g., Kafka) can also be employed for data ingestion
   and real-time knowledge synchronization across distributed Agents.

5.3.4.  Multi-Agent System to Network Digital Twin Interface

   The interface between Multi-Agent System and Network Digital Twin are
   the application-facing interface as defined in
   [I-D.irtf-nmrg-network-digital-twin-arch].

5.3.5.  Autonomous Domain to Physical Network Interface

5.3.5.1.  Data Collection

   Data Collection interface is responsible for gathering data from the
   physical network through various different tools and methods (e.g.,
   IPFIX [RFC7011], YANG-push [RFC8639],[RFC8641], BMP [RFC7854]).  It
   collects various types of network data including configuration data,
   operational data, network topology, routing data, logs, and trace on
   management plane, control plane, and forwarding plane as needed.  The
   collected data is fed into the Network Digital Twin and Network AI
   Agent(s) to provide with up-to-date information about the current
   state of the physical network.

5.3.5.2.  Configuration

   Once network decisions are made and confirmed, the Multi-Agent System
   performs specific actions to the physical network, e.g., modify
   specific configuration on network controllers or network devices
   through protocols like NETCONF [RFC6241] , RESTCONF [RFC8040], MCP
   [MCP].  It is the component that makes the planned control and
   management changes a reality in the real physical network.

6.  AI Driven Network Operations: Relationship Between Characteristics
    and Functional Components

   The architecture in Figure 2 provides a concrete implementation
   framework to realize the six key characteristics of AI-driven network
   operations described in Section 4.  Each characteristic is directly
   supported by specific functional components within the Autonomous
   Domain.  The following clarifies how the architecture operationalizes
   these characteristics:

   *  Intent:  The Network Applications Layer conveys a high-level user
         intent via northbound interfaces.  The Network AI Agent
         interprets this intent and translates it into actionable
         network operation tasks to each task Agent.

   *  Knowledge:  The Knowledge Base in Agent Gateway serves as the
         central repository for domain-specific knowledge, expert rules,
         and historical data.  It provides the necessary context and
         long/short memory to support accurate decision-making by task
         Agents.

   *  Analysis:  The AI Agent in Multi-Agent System performs intelligent
         analysis using data and tools.  It leverages the Network
         Digital Twin to simulate and validate scenarios, enabling data-
         driven insights and gap analysis between intent and current
         network state.

   *  Decision:  The AI Agent in Multi-Agent System makes informed
         decisions based on its analysis results.  It utilizes the
         Network Digital Twin for risk-free validation before finalizing
         decisions.  The decision may be sent to human operators for
         confirmation before actions are taken.

   *  Awareness:  The AI Agent in Multi-Agent System gathers data from
         the Physical Network, it may also fetch data from the Network
         Digital Twin which maintains a dynamic, virtual representation
         of Physical Network.  Together, they provide comprehensive
         network visibility and context-aware awareness.

   *  Execution: ：The AI Agent in Multi-Agent System implements
      validated decisions by applying configurations or control actions
      to the Physical Network via southbound interfaces such as NETCONF,
      RESTCONF, or Model Context Protocol [MCP].

7.  AI Driven Network Operations: A collection of Use Cases

   Network AI Agent could help in the following phases which are usually
   mentioned in network management:

   *  Network Planning and Design: includes the understanding of user
      intent, generation of solutions, and simulation for decision-
      making.

   *  Service Deployment: includes the construction of the physical
      network, as well as intent understanding, pre-deployment
      simulation, automated configuration, post-deployment validation,
      and other capabilities to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of
      network configuration for service deployment.

   *  Network Monitoring and Troubleshooting: includes intent
      monitoring, issues identification, solution generation, evaluation
      and decision-making, solution implementation, and service
      validation.

   *  Network Change and Optimization: involves the design, evaluation,
      decision-making, implementation, and validation of network
      configuration changes or optimizations to improve network
      operation efficiency.

   In all phases and use cases, after the Agent performs specific
   action, it always continuously monitors the network by data
   collection.  Based on the result of network running analysis and user
   explicit feedback, it may adjust and optimize the management strategy
   if necessary.

7.1.  Multi-Agent Collaboration on Network Configuration Change

   Network configuration changes are needed in scenarios such as
   optimizing network or service performance, provisioning new network
   services, or resolving network incidents/faults.

     Figure 3: Intent Based Network Configuration Change Usage Example

   Network configuration change leveraging Network AI Agent and Network
   Digital Twin may experience the following typical steps:

   Step 1:  The network operator inputs the intent of network
      configuration change into the Network AI Agent using natural
      language.  The network operator may simply explain the objectives
      and requirements of the changes.

   Step 2:  Network AI Agent first verifies the identity of the user
      requesting the change and checks the user's permissions to make
      certain types of network changes against predefined rules or
      policies.  It then understands and parses the initial intent of
      the request, by leveraging the powerful knowledge and reasoning
      capabilities of LLM and decompose the tasks into configuration
      generation task, configuration distribution task, configuration
      validation task and assign to corresponding task agents.
      Configuration generation Task Agent first generates initial
      suggestions for specific network configuration update, which may
      include multiple possible network configuration change plans if
      possible.

   Step 3:  Network AI Agent further communicates with the Configuration
      Validation task agent and Network Digital Twin task agent to
      validate the suggested configuration change, including the syntax
      and semantics of the configuration, verification of effected
      application and resources.  The network digital Twin task agent
      may generate a report indicating the validation result, and
      suggested configuration fix when the validation fails after
      network simulation leveraging the current physical network
      operational state.

   Step 4:  Network AI Agent may generate a configuration change plan
      and submit to the network operator for approval.  Based on the
      feedback from the operator, Network AI Agent then further decides
      whether to optimize the change plan or deliver the plan to the
      Configuration Distribution task agent to conduct the physical
      network configuration change.  The configuration distribution task
      agent may further communicate with resource allocation task agent
      to obtain network resource (e.g.,vlan, IP subnet) allocated by
      resource allocation task agent.

              Figure 4: Network Troubleshooting Usage Example

   The network operator inputs the intent of network configuration
   change into the Network AI Agent using natural language.  Network AI
   Agent could plan and decompose network troubleshooting tasks and
   coordinate with fault identification task agent, fault diagnosis task
   agent, fault repair task agent and fault prediction task agent to
   assist in network troubleshooting in the following significant
   aspects:

   *  Fault Identification:  Network AI Agent coordinates with fault
         identification task agent continuously monitors and aggregates
         data from various sources, the comprehensive data collection
         provides a holistic view of the network operational state.  By
         analyzing the real-time data, fault identification task Agent
         could detect network anomalies swiftly, which enables the
         prompt identification of potential issues before they escalate
         into major faults, minimizing downtime or service disruptions.
         In some cases, the Leightweight AI located in the Network
         Element may handle some simple fault identification tasks
         (e.g., optical module fault automatic identification) to
         enhance the awareness, while the fault identification task
         agent and LLM could leverage their powerful processing
         capabilities to analyze the time-domain data collected from the
         optical module.

   *  Fault Diagnosis:  Once a fault is identified, Network AI Agent
         coordinate with fault diagnosis task agent to delve into
         diagnosing the exact cause, fault diagnosis task agent may also
         invoke some existing operations such as "incident-diagnose" RPC
         defined in [I-D.ietf-nmop-network-incident-yang].  By
         correlating symptoms and/or applying AI models trained on
         historical data, fault diagnosis task agent can narrow down the
         potential causes and pinpoint the exact cause, which
         accelerates the diagnosis process and reduces the time needed
         to address the issue.

   *  Fault Repair:  After diagnosing the fault, Network AI Agent can
         coordinate with fault repair task agent to generate targeted
         repair solutions.  These solutions range from specific
         configuration adjustments to more complex fixes (e.g., hardware
         replacement).  Fault Repair task Agent would also communicate
         with the Network Digital Twin task agent to simulate the
         proposed repair solutions and get feedback from the Network
         Digital Twin task agent.  In advanced setups, fault repair task
         agent may automatically execute these repairs, ensuring quick
         restoration of normal operations and enhancing the overall
         reliability and efficiency of network management.  But the
         fault repair task agent may also first present the fault
         details and repair advice to the network operator for review,
         and proceed to carry out the repair task once it is confirmed.

   *  Fault Prediction  As an advanced enhancement of fault management
         capabilities, fault prediction aims to reduce network risks
         through proactive management that prevents problems before they
         occur.  Before a fault actually occurs, the fault prediction
         task agent can coordiante with network digital twin task agent
         to construct a dynamic simulation model by collecting real-time
         multi-dimensional operational state data, including network
         topology, traffic load, and device performance indicators.
         Based on the network data, the fault predication task agent
         uses large models and machine learning algorithms (such as
         time-series prediction models and anomaly detection models) to
         reason and analyze potential faults—for example, predicting the
         risk of physical link interruption based on optical cable
         signal attenuation data.  Furthermore, the fault prediction
         task Agent generates recommended operations to avoid faults and
         validates them through simulation in the network digital twin
         task agent, thereby achieving predictive maintenance of the
         network.

7.3.  Network Optimization

   Network optimization is often introduced due to the Network AI
   Agent's awareness of some potential network faults or anomalies
   through continuously monitoring of network operational state, e.g.,
   AI models may predicts network congestion by analyzing historical and
   real-time network traffic data.  It may also be triggered by the
   network operator actively inputting the network optimization intent.

   Based on the analysis of network data and user's intent (if any), AI
   Agent proposes network optimization strategies.  For instance, once
   the network congestion sometime in the future is predicted, it may
   proactively optimize the network configuration, or suggest scaling up
   to meet specific demands.

   Before the network optimization is conducted, Network AI Agent
   implements and evaluates the optimization solution using the Network
   Digital Twin.  This may need repeated trials and validations based on
   specific evaluation criteria, before the optimal strategy could be
   selected.  Network AI Agent may also first present the suggested
   network optimization solution to the network operator for review, and
   apply it to the physical network after obtaining approval from the
   network operator.

7.4.  Network level Energy Efficiency Management

   Network level Energy Efficiency refer to a set of processes used to
   discover a inventory of capabilities, use specific metrics to monitor
   and assess energy consumption of the network , operate, and control
   the use of available energy in an optimized manner while achieving
   the network’s functional and performance requirements by improving
   overall network utilization.

   Network level Energy Efficiency allows network operators not only see
   real time energy consumption in the network devices of large scale
   network through interaction with the GREEN Network AI Agent, but also
   allow them see

   o which network devices enable energy saving, which devices not,which
   are legacy ones,

   o The total energy consumption changing trend over the time of the
   day, for all network devices,

   o Energy efficiency changing trend over the time of the day for the
   whole network.

   On the other hand, With the better observability to energy
   consumption statistics data and energy efficiency statistics data,
   the Network AI Agent can know which part of the network need to be
   adjusted or optimized based on network status change.

7.5.  Network Security Drills

   The AI Agent can help construct a dynamic attack-defense verification
   system in network security drills through NDT and AI reasoning
   capabilities.  It uses generative AI to automatically generate
   diversified attack paths, models network topologies with graph neural
   networks, covers attack stages such as reconnaissance and
   penetration, and dynamically adjusts strategies via reinforcement
   learning to simulate the adaptive characteristics of network attacks.
   The virtual range built based on the NDT can 1:1 map the production
   environment, supporting simulations of composite scenarios like
   ransomware chain attacks and supply chain attacks—such as simulating
   the entire process of Conti virus laterally penetrating to domain
   controllers through weak passwords.

   During drills, the AI Agent automatically deploys virtual
   environments with vulnerabilities, collects defense response data in
   real time through NDT, and generates attack path heatmaps and repair
   suggestions.  This capability can further verify emergency response
   processes, inject real-time threat intelligence to dynamically update
   drill scenarios, and simulate end-to-end automated deployment,
   vulnerability injection, and real-time analysis of security drills,
   enhancing the proactive verification ability of defense systems
   against real-world threats.

8.  Challenges of Integrating Service-oriented AI into Network
    Management

   In addition to the research challenges in coupling AI and network
   management specified in [I-D.irtf-nmrg-ai-challenges], this document
   also identifies some challenges that need to be considered when
   integrating service-oriented AI into network management.

8.1.  Hallucination

   Hallucination refers to the generation of AI responses that are
   incorrect, irrelevant, or even nonsensical in relation to the input
   or context provided.  Although Gen-AI can produce seemingly
   impressive results at first glance, there's a risk of them being
   completely wrong at times.  These hallucinations can lead to
   incorrect decisions and actions in network management.  For example,
   if the AI generates inaccurate network configurations or diagnoses
   faults incorrectly, it may cause network disruptions or security
   vulnerabilities.  The challenge lies in identifying and correcting
   these hallucinations to ensure the reliability of AI-driven network
   management actions.

8.2.  Security

   Integrating AI into network management introduces new security
   challenges.  Large volumes of network data needs to be accessed to
   learn network behaviors and make accurate decisions.  Protecting
   sensitive network data and ensuring the integrity of AI-generated
   decisions are crucial.  Besides, AI systems can become targets for
   attacks aimed at compromising network security.  For instance,
   malicious actors could attempt to manipulate AI models to make them
   generate harmful network configurations or to disclose confidential
   network information.  Additionally, the integration of AI Agents from
   different vendors may create new vulnerabilities that need to be
   addressed, e.g., lack of effective authentication and authorization
   among different Agents.  In summary, ensuring robust security
   measures throughout the entire AI-based network management
   architecture is essential to prevent unauthorized access and maintain
   the security of the network infrastructure.

8.3.  Data Quality and Consistency

   The performance of AI models heavily relies on the quality and
   consistency of the data they're trained on.  In network management
   area, data sources can be diverse and heterogeneous, leading to
   potential issues such as data inconsistencies, missing, or outdated
   data.  Poor-quality data may result in inaccurate AI predictions and
   decisions.  For example, if incorrect or outdated network
   configuration data is provided, the model may provide incorrect
   repair advice when diagnosing network incidents or faults, it may
   suggest checking an non-existing interface.  Ensuring that data is
   properly cleaned, validated, and maintained is a significant
   challenge in providing reliable inputs for AI-driven network
   management.

8.4.  Interpretability and Explainability

   AI-generated decisions can sometimes be difficult to interpret and
   explain, as the AI model structure and the parameter settings make it
   hard to track its internal decision-making logic.  Network operators
   need to understand the reasoning behind AI-driven decisions to trust
   and effectively utilize them.  For example, if an AI system
   recommends a particular configuration change to optimize the network
   performance, operators may wonder why that specific change is being
   suggested.  The lack of interpretability can hinder the adoption of
   AI Driven Network Management and make it challenging to identify
   potential issues with AI-generated recommendations.

8.5.  Fast Decision-making

   In network operation and maintenance scenarios with high real-time
   requirements, such as scheduling strategy optimization and critical
   fault repair, the rapid generation of network optimization decisions
   is crucial.  However, AI Agents based on large models adopt a "Token-
   based" generation and reasoning approach, which is limited by
   computing power and algorithms, resulting in generally slow reasoning
   speeds.  In addition, the simulation and verification process of
   Network Digital Twin (NDT) further increases decision latency, which
   leads to long end-to-end decision-making time in complex scenarios
   and is difficult to meet the real-time requirements of services.  To
   improve decision efficiency, continuous efforts are needed in
   lightweight NDT modeling algorithms, optimizing large model reasoning
   frameworks (such as quantization technology and parallel computing),
   and deploying high-performance AI acceleration hardware.

9.  Security Considerations

   The security consideration from
   [I-D.irtf-nmrg-network-digital-twin-arch] apply here.  In addition,
   the following architectural risks need to be considered:

   *  Single point of failure: While the architecture provides
      resiliency through its recovery capabilities, the network digital
      twin or Network AI Agent could become a single point of failure if
      not implemented with sufficientcredundancy and fault tolerance.

   *  AI/ML model integrity: If the AI/ML models used by the digital
      twin are compromised or poisoned with bad data, they could begin
      making incorrect or malicious decisions.  Robust checks and
      validation are necessary to ensure the integrity of these models.

   *  Lifecycle security: The entire lifecycle of the network AI agents
      and the network digital twin—from initial deployment and
      configuration to updates and decommissioning—must be secured
      against unauthorized access and manipulation.

10.  IANA Considerations
